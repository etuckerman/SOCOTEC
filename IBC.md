# PREFACE

## Introduction

The International Building Code® (IBC®) establishes minimum requirements for building systems using prescriptive and performance-related provisions. It is founded on broad-based principles that make possible the use of new materials and new building designs. This 2018 edition is fully compatible with all of the International Codes® (I-Codes®) published by the International Code Council® (ICC®), including the International Energy Conservation Code®, International Existing Building Code®, International Fire Code®, International Fuel Gas Code®, International Green Construction Code®, International Mechanical Code®, International Plumbing Code®, International Private Sewage Disposal Code®, International Property Maintenance Code®, International Residential Code®, International Swimming Pool and Spa Code®, International Wildland-Urban Interface Code®, International Zoning Code® and International Code Council Performance Code®.

The I-Codes, including this International Building Code, are used in a variety of ways in both the public and private sectors. Most industry professionals are familiar with the I-Codes as the basis of laws and regulations in communities across the U.S. and in other countries. However, the impact of the codes extends well beyond the regulatory arena, as they are used in a variety of nonregulatory settings, including:

- Voluntary compliance programs such as those promoting sustainability, energy efficiency and disaster resistance.
- The insurance industry, to estimate and manage risk, and as a tool in underwriting and rate decisions.
- Certification and credentialing of individuals involved in the fields of building design, construction and safety.
- Certification of building and construction-related products.
- U.S. federal agencies, to guide construction in an array of government-owned properties.
- Facilities management.
- "Best practices" benchmarks for designers and builders, including those who are engaged in projects in jurisdictions that do not have a formal regulatory system or a governmental enforcement mechanism.
- College, university and professional school textbooks and curricula.
- Reference works related to building design and construction.

In addition to the codes themselves, the code development process brings together building professionals on a regular basis. It provides an international forum for discussion and deliberation about building design, construction methods, safety, performance requirements, technological advances and innovative products.

## Development

This 2018 edition presents the code as originally issued, with changes reflected in the 2003 through 2015 editions and further changes approved by the ICC Code Development Process through 2017. A new edition such as this is promulgated every 3 years.

This code is intended to establish provisions that adequately protect public health, safety and welfare; that do not unnecessarily increase construction costs; that do not restrict the use of new materials, products or methods of construction; and that do not give preferential treatment to particular types or classes of materials, products or methods of construction.

The image provides information about the maintenance and development process of the International Building Code (IBC). Here are the key points:

1. Maintenance:
   - The IBC is kept up to date through review of proposed changes submitted by various parties.
   - The ICC Code Development Process is open, transparent, and balanced.
   - It follows principles embodied in OMB Circular A-119 for federal use of private-sector standards.
   - Participation is free and can be done through ICC's cloud-based app, cdpAccess.

2. Industry Partnerships:
   - ICC has partnerships with key industry segments to ensure representation.
   - Some code development committee members are nominated by partners like:
     - American Institute of Architects (AIA)
     - National Association of Home Builders (NAHB)
     - National Association of State Fire Marshals (NASFM)

3. Code Development Process:
   - Committees evaluate and make recommendations on proposed changes.
   - Recommendations are subject to public comment and council-wide votes.
   - Final votes are cast by ICC's governmental members (public safety officials).

4. Disclaimer:
   - ICC, its members, and participants disclaim liability from publication or use of the I-Codes.
   - ICC does not have the power to enforce compliance with the code.

5. Code Development Committee Responsibilities:
   - 11 different committees consider code change proposals in each cycle.
   - Four main committees have primary responsibility for specific chapters:
     - IBC—Egress Committee [BE]: Chapters 10, 11, Appendix E
     - IBC—Fire Safety Committee [BF]: Chapters 7, 8, 9, 14, 26
     - IBC—General Committee [BG]: Chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 12, 27-33, Appendices A, B, C, D, K, N
     - IBC—Structural Committee [BS]: Chapters 15-25, Appendices F, G, H, I, J, L, M

This information outlines the process of maintaining and updating the International Building Code, emphasizing its collaborative and transparent nature.

This image provides information about code change proposals and committee designations for the International Building Code (IBC) and related codes. Here are the key points:

1. Code change proposals to sections preceded by bracketed letter designations (e.g., [A], [F]) are considered by specific committees other than the main building code committee.

2. The image lists various committee designations and their meanings, such as:
   [A] = Administrative Code Development Committee
   [BE] = IBC—Egress Code Development Committee
   [BF] = IBC—Fire Safety Code Development Committee
   [BG] = IBC—General Code Development Committee
   [BS] = IBC—Structural Code Development Committee
   [E] = International Commercial/Residential Energy Conservation Code Development Committee
   [EB] = International Existing Building Code Development Committee
   [F] = International Fire Code Development Committee
   [FG] = International Fuel Gas Code Development Committee
   [M] = International Mechanical Code Development Committee
   [P] = International Plumbing Code Development Committee

3. For the 2021 edition of the I-Codes, there will be two groups of code development committees meeting in separate years.

4. The image provides examples of how different sections are handled by various committees during different code development cycles (Group A in 2018, Group B in 2019).

This information is crucial for understanding the process of code development and which committees are responsible for different sections of the International Building Code and related codes.

Note: Proposed changes to the ICC Performance Code™ will be heard by the code development committee noted in brack-
ets [ ] in the text of the ICC Performance Code™.

Code change proposals submitted for code sections that have a letter designation in front of
them will be heard by the respective committee responsible for such code sections. Because differ-
ent committees hold Committee Action Hearings in different years, proposals for the IBC will be
heard by committees in both the 2018 (Group A) and the 2019 (Group B) code development cycles.

For instance, every section of Chapter 16 is the responsibility of the IBC—Structural Code Devel-
opment Committee. As noted in the preceding table, that committee will hold its Committee Action
Hearings in 2019 to consider code change proposals for the chapters for which it is responsible.
Therefore any proposals received for Chapter 16 of this code will be assigned to the IBC—Structural
Code Development Committee and will be considered in 2019, during the Group B code change
cycle.

As another example, every section of Chapter 1 of this code is designated as the responsibility of
the Administrative Code Development Committee, which is part of the Group B portion of the hear-
ings. This committee will hold its Committee Action Hearings in 2019 to consider code change pro-
posals for Chapter 1 of all I-Codes except the International Energy Conservation Code, International
Residential Code and International Green Construction Code. Therefore, any proposals received for
Chapter 1 of this code will be assigned to the Administrative Code Development Committee for con-
sideration in 2019.

It is very important that anyone submitting code change proposals understands which code
development committee is responsible for the section of the code that is the subject of the code
change proposal. For further information on the Code Development Committee responsibilities,
please visit the ICC website at www.iccsafe.org/scoping.

The image provides an overview of the effective use of the International Building Code (IBC) and its arrangement and format. Here are the key points:

1. The IBC is a model code that provides minimum requirements for safeguarding public health, safety, and welfare in new and existing buildings and structures.

2. It is compatible with other ICC codes, including energy conservation, fire, plumbing, mechanical, and other specialized codes.

3. The IBC addresses structural strength, egress, sanitation, lighting, ventilation, accessibility, energy conservation, and life safety for buildings and facilities.

4. It applies to all occupancies, including one- and two-family dwellings and townhouses not covered by the International Residential Code (IRC).

5. The code is arranged in chapters that follow the general sequence of a plan review or inspection:

   - Chapters 1-2: Administration and definitions
   - Chapter 3: Use and occupancy classifications
   - Chapters 4, 31: Special requirements for specific occupancies or elements
   - Chapters 5-6: Height and area limitations based on construction type
   - Chapters 7-9: Fire resistance and protection requirements
   - Chapter 10: Evacuation requirements
   - Chapter 11: Accessibility requirements
   - Chapters 12-13, 27-30: Building systems (lighting, HVAC, plumbing, elevators)
   - Chapters 14-26: Structural components
   - Chapter 32: Encroachment outside property lines
   - Chapter 33: Safeguards during construction
   - Chapter 35: Referenced standards
   - Appendices A-M: Additional information

This arrangement helps users navigate the code efficiently and find relevant information for different aspects of building design and construction.

The image provides an overview of how different sections of the International Building Code (IBC) correlate with other international codes, specifically the International Fire Code (IFC), International Mechanical Code (IMC), and International Plumbing Code (IPC). Here's a summary of the key information:

1. IBC and IFC correlation:
   - Sections 307, 414, 415 of IBC correlate with Chapters 50-67 of IFC for hazardous materials and Group H requirements
   - Chapter 7 of both codes deals with fire-resistance-rated construction
   - Chapter 8 covers interior finish, decorative materials and furnishings
   - Chapter 9 addresses fire protection systems
   - Chapter 10 deals with means of egress
   - Chapter 27 of IBC correlates with Section 604 of IFC for standby and emergency power
   - Section 3103 of IBC correlates with Chapter 31 of IFC for temporary structures

2. IBC and IMC correlation:
   - Section 717 of IBC correlates with Section 607 of IMC for smoke and fire dampers
   - Section 909 of IBC correlates with Section 513 of IMC for smoke control

3. IBC and IPC correlation:
   - Chapter 29 of IBC correlates with Chapters 3 & 4 of IPC for plumbing fixtures and facilities

The image also provides brief descriptions of Chapters 1 and 2 of the IBC:

- Chapter 1 establishes the scope, applicability, and administration of the code.
- Chapter 2 contains definitions of terms used throughout the code.

The document emphasizes the importance of every word, term, and punctuation mark in the code, as they can impact the meaning and intended results of the code provisions.

---


meaning in the code and the code meaning can differ substantially from the ordinarily understood
meaning of the term as used outside of the code. Where understanding of a term's definition is
especially key to or necessary for understanding a particular code provision, the term is shown in
italics wherever it appears in the code.

The user of the code should be familiar with and consult this chapter because the definitions are
essential to the correct interpretation of the code. Where a term is not defined, such terms shall
have the ordinarily accepted meaning.

Chapter 3 Use and Occupancy Classification. Chapter 3 provides for the classification of
buildings, structures and parts thereof based on the purpose or purposes for which they are used.
Section 302 identifies the groups into which all buildings, structures and parts thereof must be clas-
sified. Sections 303 through 312 identify the occupancy characteristics of each group classification.
In some sections, specific group classifications having requirements in common are collectively
organized such that one term applies to all. For example, Groups A-1, A-2, A-3, A-4 and A-5 are indi-
vidual groups for assembly-type buildings. The general term "Group A," however, includes each of
these individual groups. Other groups include Business (B), Educational (E), Factory (F-1, F-2), High
Hazard (H-1, H-2, H-3, H-4, H-5), Institutional (I-1, I-2, I-3, I-4), Mercantile (M), Residential (R-1, R-2,
R-3, R-4), Storage (S-1, S-2) and Utility (U). In some occupancies, the smaller number means a higher
hazard, but that is not always the case.

Defining the use of the buildings is very important as it sets the tone for the remaining chapters
of the code. Occupancy works with the height, area and construction type requirements in Chapters
5 and 6, as well as the special provisions in Chapter 4, to determine "equivalent risk," or providing a
reasonable level of protection or life safety for building occupants. The determination of equivalent
risk involves three interdependent considerations: (1) the level of fire hazard associated with the
specific occupancy of the facility; (2) the reduction of fire hazard by limiting the floor area and the
height of the building based on the fuel load (combustible contents and burnable building compo-
nents); and (3) the level of overall fire resistance provided by the type of construction used for the
building. The greater the potential fire hazards indicated as a function of the group, the lesser the
height and area allowances for a particular construction type.

Occupancy classification also plays a key part in organizing and prescribing the appropriate pro-
tection measures. As such, threshold requirements for fire protection and means of egress systems
are based on occupancy classification (see Chapters 9 and 10). Other sections of the code also con-
tain requirements respective to the classification of building groups. For example, Section 706 spec-
ifies requirements for fire wall fire-resistance ratings that are tied to the occupancy classification of
a building and Section 803.11 contains interior finish requirements that are dependent upon the
occupancy classification. The use of the space, rather than the occupancy of the building, is utilized
for determining occupant loading (Section 1004) and live loading (Section 1607).

Over the useful life of a building, the activities in the building will evolve and change. Where the
provisions of the code address uses differently, moving from one activity to another or from one
level of activity to another is, by definition, a change of occupancy. The new occupancy must be in
compliance with the applicable provisions.

Chapter 4 Special Detailed Requirements Based on Use and Occupancy. Chapter 4 con-
tains the requirements for protecting special uses and occupancies, which are supplemental to the
remainder of the code. Chapter 4 contains provisions that may alter requirements found elsewhere
in the code; however, the general requirements of the code still apply unless modified within the
chapter. For example, the height and area limitations established in Chapter 5 apply to all special
occupancies unless Chapter 4 contains height and area limitations. In this case, the limitations in
Chapter 4 supersede those in other sections. An example of this is the height and area limitations
for open parking garages given in Section 406.5.4, which supersede the limitations given in Sections
504 and 506.

In some instances, it may not be necessary to apply the provisions of Chapter 4. For example, if a
covered mall building complies with the provisions of the code for Group M, Section 402 does not
apply; however, other sections that address a use, process or operation must be applied to that spe-
cific occupancy, such as stages and platforms, special amusement buildings and hazardous materials
(Sections 410, 411 and 414).

The chapter includes requirements for buildings and conditions that apply to one or more
groups, such as high-rise buildings, underground buildings or atriums. Special uses may also imply
specific occupancies and operations, such as for Group H, hazardous materials, application of flam-

mable finishes, drying rooms, organic coatings and combustible storage or hydrogen fuel gas rooms,
all of which are coordinated with the IFC. Unique consideration is taken for special use areas, such
as covered mall buildings, motor-vehicle-related occupancies, special amusement buildings and air-
craft-related occupancies. Special facilities within other occupancies are considered, such as stages
and platforms, motion picture projection rooms, children's play structures and storm shelters.
Finally, in order that the overall package of protection features can be easily understood, unique
considerations for specific occupancies are addressed: Groups I-1, I-2, I-3, R-1, R-2, R-3 and R-4;
ambulatory care facilities and live/work units.

Chapter 5 General Building Heights and Areas. Chapter 5 contains the provisions that regu-
late the minimum type of construction for area limits and height limits based on the occupancy of
the building. Height and area increases (including allowances for basements, mezzanines and equip-
ment platforms) are permitted based on open frontage for fire department access, separation and
the type of sprinkler protection provided (Sections 503-506, 510). These thresholds are reduced for
buildings over three stories in height in accordance with Sections 506.2.3 and 506.2.4. Provisions
include the protection and/or separation of incidental uses (Table 509), accessory occupancies (Sec-
tion 508.2) and mixed uses in the same building (Sections 506.2.2, 506.2.4, 508.3, 508.4 and 510).
Unlimited area buildings are permitted in certain occupancies when they meet special provisions
(Section 507).

Tables 504.3, 504.4 and 506.2 are the keystones in setting thresholds for building size based on
the building's use and the materials with which it is constructed. If one then looks at Tables 504.3,
504.4 and 506.2, the relationship among group classification, allowable heights and areas and types
of construction becomes apparent. Respective to each group classification, the greater the fire-
resistance rating of structural elements, as represented by the type of construction, the greater the
floor area and height allowances. The greater the potential fire hazards indicated as a function of
the group, the lesser the height and area allowances for a particular construction type. Starting in
the 2015 edition, the table that once contained both height and area has been separated and these
three new tables address the topics individually. In addition, the tables list criteria for buildings with
and without automatic sprinkler systems.

Chapter 6 Types of Construction. The interdependence of these fire safety considerations can
be seen by first looking at Tables 601 and 602, which show the fire-resistance ratings of the principal
structural elements comprising a building in relation to the five classifications for types of construc-
tion. Type I construction is the classification that generally requires the highest fire-resistance rat-
ings for structural elements, whereas Type V construction, which is designated as a combustible
type of construction, generally requires the least amount of fire-resistance-rated structural ele-
ments. The greater the potential fire hazards indicated as a function of the group, the lesser the
height and area allowances for a particular construction type. Section 603 includes a list of combus-
tible elements that can be part of a noncombustible building (Types I and II construction).

Chapter 7 Fire and Smoke Protection Features. The provisions of Chapter 7 present the fun-
damental concepts of fire performance that all buildings are expected to achieve in some form. This
chapter identifies the acceptable materials, techniques and methods by which proposed construc-
tion can be designed and evaluated against to determine a building's ability to limit the impact of
fire. The fire-resistance-rated construction requirements within Chapter 7 provide passive resis-
tance to the spread and effects of fire. Types of separations addressed include fire walls, fire barri-
ers, fire partitions, horizontal assemblies, smoke barriers and smoke partitions. A fire produces heat
that can weaken structural components and smoke products that cause property damage and place
occupants at risk. The requirements of Chapter 7 work in unison with height and area requirements
(Chapter 5), active fire detection and suppression systems (Chapter 9) and occupant egress require-
ments (Chapter 10) to contain a fire should it occur while helping ensure occupants are able to
safely exit.

Chapter 8 Interior Finishes. This chapter contains the performance requirements for con-
trolling fire growth within buildings by restricting interior finish and decorative materials. Past fire
experience has shown that interior finish and decorative materials are key elements in the develop-
ment and spread of fire. The provisions of Chapter 8 require materials used as interior finishes and
decorations to meet certain flame-spread index or flame-propagation criteria based on the relative
fire hazard associated with the occupancy. As smoke is also a hazard associated with fire, this chap-
ter contains limits on the smoke development characteristics of interior finishes. The performance
of the material is evaluated based on test standards.

Here is the transcription of the image content in markdown:

# Chapter 9 Fire Protection Systems.
Chapter 9 prescribes the minimum requirements for active systems of fire protection equipment to perform the following functions: detect a fire; alert the occupants or fire department of a fire emergency; and control smoke and control or extinguish the fire. Generally, the requirements are based on the occupancy, the height and the area of the building, because these are the factors that most affect fire-fighting capabilities and the relative hazard of a specific building or portion thereof. This chapter parallels and is substantially duplicated in Chapter 9 of the International Fire Code (IFC); however, the IFC Chapter 9 also contains periodic testing criteria that are not contained in the IBC. In addition, the special fire protection system requirements based on use and occupancy found in IBC Chapter 4 are duplicated in IFC Chapter 9 as a user convenience.

# Chapter 10 Means of Egress.
The general criteria set forth in Chapter 10 regulating the design of the means of egress are established as the primary method for protection of people in buildings by allowing timely relocation or evacuation of building occupants. Both prescriptive and performance language is utilized in this chapter to provide for a basic approach in the determination of a safe exiting system for all occupancies. It addresses all portions of the egress system (i.e., exit access, exits and exit discharge) and includes design requirements as well as provisions regulating individual components. The requirements detail the size, arrangement, number and protection of means of egress components. Functional and operational characteristics also are specified for the components that will permit their safe use without special knowledge or effort. The means of egress protection requirements work in coordination with other sections of the code, such as protection of vertical openings (see Chapter 7), interior finish (see Chapter 8), fire suppression and detection systems (see Chapter 9) and numerous others, all having an impact on life safety. Chapter 10 of the IBC is duplicated in Chapter 10 of the IFC; however, the IFC contains one additional section on the means of egress system in existing buildings.

# Chapter 11 Accessibility.
Chapter 11 contains provisions that set forth requirements for accessibility of buildings and their associated sites and facilities for people with physical disabilities. The fundamental philosophy of the code on the subject of accessibility is that everything is required to be accessible. This is reflected in the basic applicability requirement (see Section 1103.1). The code's scoping requirements then address the conditions under which accessibility is not required in terms of exceptions to this general mandate. While the IBC contains scoping provisions for accessibility (for example, what, where and how many), ICC A117.1, Accessible and Usable Buildings and Facilities, is the referenced standard for the technical provisions (in other words, how).

There are many accessibility issues that not only benefit people with disabilities, but also provide a tangible benefit to people without disabilities. This type of requirement can be set forth in the code as generally applicable without necessarily identifying it specifically as an accessibility-related issue. Such a requirement would then be considered as having been "mainstreamed." For example, visible alarms are located in Chapter 9 and accessible means of egress and ramp requirements are addressed in Chapter 10.

Accessibility criteria for existing buildings are addressed in the International Existing Building Code (IEBC).

Appendix E is supplemental information included in the code to address accessibility for items in the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design that were not typically enforceable through the standard traditional building code enforcement approach system (for example, beds, room signage). The International Residential Code (IRC) references Chapter 11 for accessibility provisions; therefore, this chapter may be applicable to housing covered under the IRC.

# Chapter 12 Interior Environment.
Chapter 12 provides minimum standards for the interior environment of a building. The standards address the minimum sizes of spaces, minimum temperature levels, and minimum light and ventilation levels. The collection of requirements addresses limiting sound transmission through walls, ventilation of attic spaces and under floor spaces (crawl spaces). Finally, the chapter provides minimum standards for toilet and bathroom construction, including privacy shielding and standards for walls, partitions and floors to resist water intrusion and damage.

# Chapter 13 Energy Efficiency.
The purpose of Chapter 13 is to provide minimum design requirements that will promote efficient utilization of energy in buildings. The requirements are directed toward the design of building envelopes with adequate thermal resistance and low air

leakage, and toward the design and selection of mechanical, water heating, electrical and illumina-
tion systems that promote effective use of depletable energy resources. For the specifics of these
criteria, Chapter 13 requires design and construction in compliance with the International Energy
Conservation Code (IECC).

Chapter 14 Exterior Walls. This chapter addresses requirements for exterior walls of buildings.
Minimum standards for wall covering materials, installation of wall coverings and the ability of the
wall to provide weather protection are provided. This chapter also requires exterior walls that are
close to lot lines, or that are bearing walls for certain types of construction, to comply with the min-
imum fire-resistance ratings specified in Chapters 6 and 7. The installation of each type of wall cov-
ering, be it wood, masonry, vinyl, metal composite material or an exterior insulation and finish
system, is critical to its long-term performance in protecting the interior of the building from the
elements and the spread of fire. Limitations on the use of combustible materials on exterior build-
ing elements such as balconies, eaves, decks and architectural trim are also addressed in this chap-
ter.

Chapter 15 Roof Assemblies and Rooftop Structures. Chapter 15 provides standards for
both roof assemblies and structures that sit on top of the roofs of buildings. The criteria address
roof construction and covering, including the weather-protective barrier at the roof and, in most cir-
cumstances, a fire-resistant barrier. The chapter is prescriptive in nature and is based on decades of
experience with various traditional materials, but it also addresses newer products such as photo-
voltaic shingles. These prescriptive rules are very important for satisfying performance of one type
of roof covering or another. Section 1510 addresses rooftop structures, including penthouses,
tanks, towers and spires. Rooftop penthouses larger than prescribed in this chapter must be treated
as a story under Chapter 5.

Chapter 16 Structural Design. Chapter 16 prescribes minimum structural loading requirements
for use in the design and construction of buildings and structural components. It includes minimum
design loads, assignment of risk categories and permitted design methodologies. Standards are pro-
vided for minimum design loads (live, dead, snow, wind, rain, flood, ice and earthquake as well as
the required load combinations). The application of these loads and adherence to the serviceability
criteria will enhance the protection of life and property. The chapter references and relies on many
nationally recognized design standards. A key standard is the American Society of Civil Engineers'
Minimum Design Loads for Buildings and Other Structures (ASCE 7). Structural design must address
the conditions of the site and location. Therefore, maps are provided of rainfall, seismic, snow and
wind criteria in different regions.

Chapter 17 Special Inspections and Tests. Chapter 17 provides a variety of procedures and
criteria for testing materials and assemblies, labeling materials and assemblies and special inspec-
tion of structural assemblies. This chapter expands on the inspections of Chapter 1 by requiring spe-
cial inspection where indicated and, in some cases, structural observation. It also spells out
additional responsibilities for the owner, contractor, design professionals and special inspectors.
Proper assembly of structural components, proper quality of materials used and proper application
of materials are essential to ensuring that a building, once constructed, complies with the structural
and fire-resistance minimums of the code and the approved design. To determine this compliance
often requires continuous or frequent inspection and testing. Chapter 17 establishes standards for
special inspection, testing and reporting of the work to the building official.

Chapter 18 Soils and Foundations. Chapter 18 provides criteria for geotechnical and structural
considerations in the selection, design and installation of foundation systems to support the loads
from the structure above. This chapter includes requirements for soils investigation and site prepa-
ration for receiving a foundation, including the allowed load-bearing values for soils and for protect-
ing the foundation from water intrusion. Section 1808 addresses the basic requirements for all
foundation types. Later sections address foundation requirements that are specific to shallow foun-
dations and deep foundations. Due care must be exercised in the planning and design of foundation
systems based on obtaining sufficient soils information, the use of accepted engineering proce-
dures, experience and good technical judgment.

Chapter 19 Concrete. This chapter provides minimum accepted practices for the design and con-
struction of buildings and structural components using concrete—both plain and reinforced. Chap-

ter 19 relies primarily on the reference to American Concrete Institute (ACI) 318, Building Code
Requirements for Structural Concrete. This chapter also includes references to additional standards.
Structural concrete must be designed and constructed to comply with this code and all listed stan-
dards. There are specific sections of the chapter addressing concrete slabs, anchorage to concrete
and shotcrete. Because of the variable properties of material and numerous design and construc-
tion options available in the uses of concrete, due care and control throughout the construction
process is necessary.

Chapter 20 Aluminum. Chapter 20 contains standards for the use of aluminum in building con-
struction. Only the structural applications of aluminum are addressed. This chapter does not
address the use of aluminum in specialty products such as storefront or window framing or archi-
tectural hardware. The use of aluminum in heating, ventilating or air-conditioning systems is
addressed in the International Mechanical Code (IMC). This chapter references national standards
from the Aluminum Association for use of aluminum in building construction, AA ASM 35, Alumi-
num Sheet Metal Work in Building Construction, and AA ADM 1, Aluminum Design Manual. By utiliz-
ing the standards set forth, a proper application of this material can be obtained.

Chapter 21 Masonry. This chapter provides comprehensive and practical requirements for
masonry construction. The provisions of Chapter 21 require minimum accepted practices and the
use of standards for the design and construction of masonry structures. The provisions address:
material specifications and test methods; types of wall construction; criteria for engineered and
empirical designs; and required details of construction, including the execution of construction.
Masonry design methodologies including allowable stress design, strength design and empirical
design are covered by provisions of this chapter. Also addressed are masonry fireplaces and chim-
neys, masonry heaters and glass unit masonry. Fire-resistant construction using masonry is also
required to comply with Chapter 7. Masonry foundations are also subject to the requirements of
Chapter 18.

Chapter 22 Steel. Chapter 22 provides the requirements necessary for the design and construc-
tion of structural steel (including composite construction), cold-formed steel, steel joists, steel cable
structures and steel storage racks. This chapter specifies appropriate design and construction stan-
dards for these types of structures. It also provides a road map of the applicable technical require-
ments for steel structures. Because steel is a noncombustible building material, it is commonly
associated with Types I and II construction; however, it is permitted to be used in all types of con-
struction. Chapter 22 requires that the design and use of steel materials be in accordance with the
specifications and standards of the American Institute of Steel Construction, the American Iron and
Steel Institute, the Steel Joist Institute and the American Society of Civil Engineers.

Chapter 23 Wood. This chapter provides minimum requirements for the design of buildings and
structures that use wood and wood-based products. The chapter is organized around three design
methodologies: allowable stress design (ASD), load and resistance factor design (LRFD) and conven-
tional light-frame construction. Included in this chapter are references to design and manufacturing
standards for various wood and wood-based products; general construction requirements; design
criteria for lateral force-resisting systems and specific requirements for the application of the three
design methods. In general, only Type III, IV or V buildings may be constructed of wood.

Chapter 24 Glass and Glazing. This chapter establishes regulations for glass and glazing that,
when installed in buildings and structures, are subjected to wind, snow and dead loads. Engineering
and design requirements are included in the chapter. Additional structural requirements are found
in Chapter 16. Another concern of this chapter is glass and glazing used in areas where it is likely to
be impacted by the occupants. Section 2406 identifies hazardous locations where glazing installed
must either be safety glazing or blocked to prevent human impact. Safety glazing must meet strin-
gent standards and be appropriately marked or identified. Additional requirements are provided for
glass and glazing in guards, handrails, elevator hoistways and elevator cars, as well as in athletic
facilities.

Chapter 25 Gypsum Board, Gypsum Panel Products and Plaster. Chapter 25 contains the
provisions and referenced standards that regulate the design, construction and quality of gypsum
board, gypsum panel products and plaster. It also addresses reinforced gypsum concrete. These
represent the most common interior and exterior finish materials in the building industry. This
chapter primarily addresses quality-control-related issues with regard to material specifications and

installation requirements. Most products are manufactured under the control of industry stan-
dards. The building official or inspector primarily needs to verify that the appropriate product is
used and properly installed for the intended use and location. While often simply used as wall and
ceiling coverings, proper design and application are necessary to provide weather resistance and
required fire protection for both structural and nonstructural building components.

Chapter 26 Plastic. The use of plastics in building construction and components is addressed in
Chapter 26. This chapter provides standards addressing foam plastic insulation, foam plastics used
as interior finish and trim, and other plastic veneers used on the inside or outside of a building. Plas-
tic siding is regulated by Chapter 14. Sections 2606 through 2611 address the use of light-transmit-
ting plastics in various configurations such as walls, roof panels, skylights, signs and as glazing.
Requirements for the use of fiber-reinforced polymers, fiberglass-reinforced polymers and reflec-
tive plastic core insulation are also contained in this chapter. Additionally, requirements specific to
the use of wood-plastic composites and plastic lumber are contained in this chapter. Some plastics
exhibit rapid flame spread and heavy smoke density characteristics when exposed to fire. Exposure
to the heat generated by a fire can cause some plastics to deform, which can affect their perfor-
mance. The requirements and limitations of this chapter are necessary to control the use of plastic
and foam plastic products such that they do not compromise the safety of building occupants.

Chapter 27 Electrical. Since electrical systems and components are an integral part of almost all
structures, it is necessary for the code to address the installation of such systems. For this purpose,
Chapter 27 references the National Electrical Code (NEC). In addition, Section 2702 addresses emer-
gency and standby power requirements. Such systems must comply with the International Fire Code
(IFC) and referenced standards. This section also provides references to the various code sections
requiring emergency and standby power, such as high-rise buildings and buildings containing haz-
ardous materials.

Chapter 28 Mechanical Systems. Nearly all buildings will include mechanical systems. This
chapter provides references to the International Mechanical Code (IMC) and the International Fuel
Gas Code (IFGC) for the design and installation of mechanical systems. In addition, Chapter 21 of
this code is referenced for masonry chimneys, fireplaces and barbecues.

Chapter 29 Plumbing Systems. Chapter 29 regulates the minimum number of plumbing fix-
tures that must be provided for every type of building. This chapter also regulates the location of
the required fixtures in various types of buildings. This section requires separate facilities for males
and females except for certain types of small occupancies. The regulations in this chapter come
directly from Chapters 3 and 4 of the International Plumbing Code (IPC).

Chapter 30 Elevators and Conveying Systems. Chapter 30 provides standards for the instal-
lation of elevators into buildings. Referenced standards provide the requirements for the elevator
system and mechanisms. Detailed standards are provided in the chapter for hoistway enclosures,
machine rooms and requirements for sizing of elevators. Beginning in the 2015 edition pf this code,
the elevator lobby requirements were moved from Chapter 7 to Chapter 30 to pull all the elevator-
related construction requirements together. New provisions were added in the 2009 edition for fire
service access elevators required in high-rise buildings and for the optional choice of occupant evac-
uation elevators (see Section 403).

Chapter 31 Special Construction. Chapter 31 contains a collection of regulations for a variety of
unique structures and architectural features. Pedestrian walkways and tunnels connecting two build-
ings are addressed in Section 3104. Membrane and air-supported structures are addressed by Sec-
tion 3102. Safeguards for swimming pool safety are addressed by way of reference to the
International Swimming Pool and Spa Code (ISPSC) in Section 3109. Standards for temporary struc-
tures, including permit requirements, are provided in Section 3103. Structures as varied as awnings,
marquees, signs, telecommunication and broadcast towers and automatic vehicular gates are also
addressed (see Sections 3105 through 3108 and 3110).

Chapter 32 Encroachments into the Public Right-of-way. Buildings and structures from
time to time are designed to extend over a property line and into the public right-of-way. Local reg-
ulations outside of the building code usually set limits to such encroachments, and such regulations
take precedence over the provisions of this chapter. Standards are provided for encroachments
below grade for structural support, vaults and areaways. Encroachments above grade are divided

xvi                                                                                                   2018 INTERNATIONAL BUILDING CODE®

into below 8 feet, 8 feet to 15 feet, and above 15 feet, because of headroom and vehicular height
issues. This includes steps, columns, awnings, canopies, marquees, signs, windows and balconies.
Similar architectural features above grade are also addressed. Pedestrian walkways must also com-
ply with Chapter 31.

Chapter 33 Safeguards During Construction. Chapter 33 provides safety requirements
during construction and demolition of buildings and structures. These requirements are intended to
protect the public from injury and adjoining property from damage. In addition the chapter pro-
vides for the progressive installation and operation of exit stairways and standpipe systems during
construction.

Chapter 34 Reserved. During the 2015 code change cycle the membership voted to delete Chap-
ter 34, Existing Structures, from this code and reference the International Existing Building Code
(IEBC)®. The provisions that were in Chapter 34 will appear in the IEBC. Sections 3402 through 3411
appear as IEBC Chapter 4 and Section 3412 as Chapter 14.

Chapter 35 Referenced Standards. The code contains numerous references to standards that
are used to regulate materials and methods of construction. Chapter 35 contains a comprehensive
list of all standards that are referenced in the code, including the appendices. The standards are
part of the code to the extent of the reference to the standard (see Section 102.4). Compliance with
the referenced standard is necessary for compliance with this code. By providing specifically
adopted standards, the construction and installation requirements necessary for compliance with
the code can be readily determined. The basis for code compliance is, therefore, established and
available on an equal basis to the building official, contractor, designer and owner.

Chapter 35 is organized in a manner that makes it easy to locate specific standards. It lists all of
the referenced standards, alphabetically, by acronym of the promulgating agency of the standard.
Each agency's standards are then listed in either alphabetical or numeric order based upon the stan-
dard identification. The list also contains the title of the standard; the edition (date) of the standard
referenced; any addenda included as part of the ICC adoption; and the section or sections of this
code that reference the standard.

Appendices. Appendices are provided in the IBC to offer optional or supplemental criteria to the
provisions in the main chapters of the code. Appendices provide additional information for adminis-
tration of the Department of Building Safety as well as standards not typically administered by all
building departments. Appendices have the same force and effect as the first 35 chapters of the IBC
only when explicitly adopted by the jurisdiction.

Appendix A Employee Qualifications. Effective administration and enforcement of the family
of International Codes depends on the training and expertise of the personnel employed by the
jurisdiction and his or her knowledge of the codes. Section 103 of the code establishes the Depart-
ment of Building Safety and calls for the appointment of a building official and deputies such as
plans examiners and inspectors. Appendix A provides standards for experience, training and certifi-
cation for the building official and the other staff mentioned in Chapter 1.

Appendix B Board of Appeals. Section 113 of Chapter 1 requires the establishment of a board of
appeals to hear appeals regarding determinations made by the building official. Appendix B provides
qualification standards for members of the board as well as operational procedures of such board.

Appendix C Group U—Agricultural Buildings. Appendix C provides a more liberal set of
standards for the construction of agricultural buildings, rather than strictly following the Utility
building provision, reflective of their specific usage and limited occupant load. The provisions of this
appendix, when adopted, allow reasonable heights and areas commensurate with the risk of agri-
cultural buildings.

Appendix D Fire Districts. Fire districts have been a tool used to limit conflagration hazards in
areas of a city with intense and concentrated development. More frequently used under the model
codes that preceded the IBC, this appendix is provided to allow jurisdictions to continue the desig-
nation and use of fire districts. Fire district standards restrict certain occupancies within the district,
as well as setting higher minimum construction standards.

Here is the transcription of the image in markdown:

# Appendix E Supplementary Accessibility Requirements. 
The Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board (U.S. Access Board) has revised and updated its accessibility guidelines for buildings and facilities covered by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Architectural Barriers Act (ABA). Appendix E includes scoping requirements contained in the 2010 ADA Standards for Accessible Design that are not in Chapter 11 and not otherwise mentioned or mainstreamed throughout the code. Items in the appendix address subjects not typically addressed in building codes (for example, beds, room signage, transportation facilities).

# Appendix F Rodentproofing. 
The provisions of this appendix are minimum mechanical methods to prevent the entry of rodents into a building. These standards, when used in conjunction with cleanliness and maintenance programs, can significantly reduce the potential of rodents invading a building.

# Appendix G Flood-resistant Construction. 
Appendix G is intended to fulfill the flood-plain management and administrative requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) that are not included in the code. Communities that adopt the IBC and Appendix G will meet the minimum requirements of NFIP as set forth in Title 44 of the Code of Federal Regulations.

# Appendix H Signs. 
Appendix H gathers in one place the various code standards that regulate the construction and protection of outdoor signs. Whenever possible, this appendix provides standards in performance language, thus allowing the widest possible application.

# Appendix I Patio Covers. 
Appendix I provides standards applicable to the construction and use of patio covers. It is limited in application to patio covers accessory to dwelling units. Covers of patios and other outdoor areas associated with restaurants, mercantile buildings, offices, nursing homes or other nondwelling occupancies would be subject to standards in the main code and not this appendix.

# Appendix J Grading. 
Appendix J provides standards for the grading of properties. This appendix also provides standards for administration and enforcement of a grading program including permit and inspection requirements. Appendix J was originally developed in the 1960s and used for many years in jurisdictions throughout the western states. It is intended to provide consistent and uniform code requirements anywhere grading is considered an issue.

# Appendix K Administrative Provisions. 
Appendix K primarily provides administrative provisions for jurisdictions adopting and enforcing NFPA 70—the National Electrical Code (NEC). The provisions contained in this appendix are compatible with administrative and enforcement provisions contained in Chapter 1 of the IBC and the other International Codes. Annex H of NFPA 70 also contains administrative provisions for the NEC; however, some of its provisions are not compatible with IBC Chapter 1. Section K110 also contains technical provisions that are unique to this appendix and are in addition to technical standards of NFPA 70.

# Appendix L Earthquake Recording Instrumentation. 
The purpose of this appendix is to foster the collection of ground motion data, particularly from strong-motion earthquakes. When this ground motion data is synthesized, it may be useful in developing future improvements to the earthquake provisions of the code.

# Appendix M Tsunami-Generated Flood Hazard. 
Addressing a tsunami risk for all types of construction in a tsunami hazard zone through building code requirements would typically not be cost effective, making tsunami-resistant construction impractical at an individual building level. However, this appendix does allow the adoption and enforcement of requirements for tsunami hazard zones that regulate the presence of high-risk or high-hazard structures.

# Appendix N Replicable Buildings. 
Many jurisdictions have recognized the need for some form of expedited review process for replicable buildings. By codifying the approach contained in the ICC G1-2010 Guidelines for Replicable Buildings, this appendix provides jurisdictions with a means of incorporating replicable building requirements into their building code adoption process. The intent is to streamline the plan review process at the local level by removing redundant reviews.

2. It's divided into two parts: Part 1—Scope and Application (Sections 101–102) and Part 2—Administration and Enforcement (Sections 103–116).

3. The code is intended to be adopted as a legally enforceable document and requires adequate provisions for administration and enforcement.

4. Section 101 covers general information:
   - The title of the code (to be filled in with the name of the jurisdiction)
   - The scope, which applies to construction, alteration, relocation, enlargement, replacement, repair, use, occupancy, maintenance, removal and demolition of buildings and structures.
   - An exception for detached one- and two-family dwellings and townhouses not more than three stories above grade plane.
   - The intent of the code, which is to establish minimum requirements for safety, health, and welfare.

5. Section 101.4 lists referenced codes that are considered part of the requirements, including:
   - International Fuel Gas Code
   - International Mechanical Code
   - International Plumbing Code
   - International Property Maintenance Code
   - International Fire Code

complies with the intent of the provisions of this code, and
that the material, method or work offered is, for the purpose
intended, not less than the equivalent of that prescribed in this
code in quality, strength, effectiveness, fire resistance, dura-
bility and safety. Where the alternative material, design or
method of construction is not approved, the building official
shall respond in writing, stating the reasons why the alterna-
tive was not approved.

necessary to assist in the approval of materials or assem-
blies not specifically provided for in this code, shall con-
sist of valid research reports from approved sources.

[A] 104.11.2 Tests. Whenever there is insufficient evi-
dence of compliance with the provisions of this code, or
evidence that a material or method does not conform to the
requirements of this code, or in order to substantiate
claims for alternative materials or methods, the building
official shall have the authority to require tests as evidence
of compliance to be made without expense to the jurisdic-
tion. Test methods shall be as specified in this code or by
other recognized test standards. In the absence of recog-
nized and accepted test methods, the building official shall
approve the testing procedures. Tests shall be performed
by an approved agency. Reports of such tests shall be
retained by the building official for the period required for
retention of public records.

of other ordinances of the jurisdiction. Inspections presuming
to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of this
code or of other ordinances of the jurisdiction shall not be
valid. It shall be the duty of the owner or the owner's autho-
rized agent to cause the work to remain visible and able to be
accessed for inspection purposes. Neither the building official
nor the jurisdiction shall be liable for expense entailed in the
removal or replacement of any material required to allow
inspection.

# CHAPTER 3

# OCCUPANCY CLASSIFICATION AND USE

User note:
    About this chapter: Chapter 3 provides the criteria by which buildings and structures are classified into use groups and occupancies.
    Through the balance of the code, occupancy classification is fundamental in the setting of features of construction; occupant safety require-
    ments, especially building limitations; means of egress; fire protection systems; and interior finishes.

## SECTION 301
## SCOPE

301.1 General. The provisions of this chapter shall control
the classification of all buildings and structures as to occu-
pancy and use. Different classifications of occupancy and use
represent varying levels of hazard and risk to building occu-
pants and adjacent properties.

## SECTION 302
## OCCUPANCY CLASSIFICATION
## AND USE DESIGNATION

302.1 Occupancy classification. Occupancy classification is
the formal designation of the primary purpose of the building,
structure or portion thereof. Structures shall be classified into
one or more of the occupancy groups listed in this section
based on the nature of the hazards and risks to building occu-
pants generally associated with the intended purpose of the
building or structure. An area, room or space that is intended
to be occupied at different times for different purposes shall
comply with all applicable requirements associated with such
potential multipurpose. Structures containing multiple occu-
pancy groups shall comply with Section 508. Where a struc-
ture is proposed for a purpose that is not specifically listed in
this section, such structure shall be classified in the occu-
pancy it most nearly resembles based on the fire safety and
relative hazard. Occupied roofs shall be classified in the
group that the occupancy most nearly resembles, according to
the fire safety and relative hazard, and shall comply with Sec-
tion 503.1.4.

1. Assembly (see Section 303): Groups A-1, A-2, A-3,
   A-4 and A-5.
2. Business (see Section 304): Group B.
3. Educational (see Section 305): Group E.
4. Factory and Industrial (see Section 306): Groups F-1
   and F-2.
5. High Hazard (see Section 307): Groups H-1, H-2, H-3,
   H-4 and H-5.
6. Institutional (see Section 308): Groups I-1, I-2, I-3
   and I-4.
7. Mercantile (see Section 309): Group M.
8. Residential (see Section 310): Groups R-1, R-2, R-3
   and R-4.

9. Storage (see Section 311): Groups S-1 and S-2.
10. Utility and Miscellaneous (see Section 312): Group U.

302.2 Use designation. Occupancy groups contain subordi-
nate uses having similar hazards and risks to building occu-
pants. Uses include, but are not limited to, those functional
designations listed within the occupancy group descriptions
in Section 302.1. Certain uses require specific limitations and
controls in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 4 and
elsewhere in this code.

## SECTION 303
## ASSEMBLY GROUP A

303.1 Assembly Group A. Assembly Group A occupancy
includes, among others, the use of a building or structure, or a
portion thereof, for the gathering of persons for purposes such
as civic, social or religious functions; recreation, food or
drink consumption or awaiting transportation.

303.1.1 Small buildings and tenant spaces. A building or
tenant space used for assembly purposes with an occupant
load of less than 50 persons shall be classified as a Group
B occupancy.

303.1.2 Small assembly spaces. The following rooms and
spaces shall not be classified as Assembly occupancies:

1. A room or space used for assembly purposes with an
   occupant load of less than 50 persons and accessory
   to another occupancy shall be classified as a Group
   B occupancy or as part of that occupancy.

2. A room or space used for assembly purposes that is
   less than 750 square feet (70 m²) in area and acces-
   sory to another occupancy shall be classified as a
   Group B occupancy or as part of that occupancy.

303.1.3 Associated with Group E occupancies. A room
or space used for assembly purposes that is associated with
a Group E occupancy is not considered a separate occu-
pancy.

303.1.4 Accessory to places of religious worship.
Accessory religious educational rooms and religious audi-
toriums with occupant loads of less than 100 per room or
space are not considered separate occupancies.

303.2 Assembly Group A-1. Group A-1 occupancy includes
assembly uses, usually with fixed seating, intended for the

# SPECIAL DETAILED REQUIREMENTS BASED ON OCCUPANCY AND USE

## 402.8.1.1 Minimum width.
The aggregate clear egress width of the mall in either a covered or open mall building shall be not less than 20 feet (6096 mm). The mall width shall be sufficient to accommodate the occupant load served. Any portion of the minimum required aggregate egress width shall be not less than 10 feet (3048 mm) measured to a height of 8 feet (2438 mm) between any projection of a tenant space bordering the mall and the nearest kiosk, vending machine, bench, display opening, food court or other obstruction to means of egress travel.

## 402.8.2 Determination of occupant load.
The occupant load permitted in any individual tenant space in a covered or open mall building shall be determined as required by this code. Means of egress requirements for individual tenant spaces shall be based on the occupant load thus determined.

### 402.8.2.1 Occupant formula.
In determining required means of egress of the mall, the number of occupants for whom means of egress are to be provided shall be based on gross leasable area of the covered or open mall building (excluding anchor buildings) and the occupant load factor as determined by Equation 4-1.

OLF = (0.00007)(GLA) + 25 (Equation 4-1)

where:
OLF = The occupant load factor (square feet per person).
GLA = The gross leasable area (square feet).

**Exception:** Tenant spaces attached to a covered or open mall building but with a means of egress system that is totally independent of the open mall of an open mall building or of a covered mall building shall not be considered as gross leasable area for determining the required means of egress for the mall building.

### 402.8.2.2 OLF range.
The occupant load factor (OLF) is not required to be less than 30 and shall not exceed 50.

### 402.8.2.3 Anchor buildings.
The occupant load of anchor buildings opening into the mall shall not be included in computing the total number of occupants for the mall.

### 402.8.2.4 Food courts.
The occupant load of a food court shall be determined in accordance with Section 1004. For the purposes of determining the means of egress requirements for the mall, the food court occupant load shall be added to the occupant load of the covered or open mall building as calculated in Section 402.8.2.1.

## 402.8.3 Number of means of egress.
Wherever the distance of travel to the mall from any location within a tenant space used by persons other than employees is greater than 75 feet (22 860 mm) or the tenant space has an occupant load of 50 or more, not fewer than two means of egress shall be provided.

## 402.8.4 Arrangements of means of egress.
Assembly occupancies with an occupant load of 500 or more located within a covered mall building shall be so located such that their entrance will be immediately adjacent to a principal entrance to the mall and shall have not less than one-half of their required means of egress opening directly to the exterior of the covered mall building. Assembly occupancies located within the perimeter line of an open mall building shall be permitted to have their main exit open to the open mall.

### 402.8.4.1 Anchor building means of egress.
Required means of egress for anchor buildings shall be provided independently from the mall means of egress system. The occupant load of anchor buildings opening into the mall shall not be included in determining means of egress requirements for the mall. The path of egress travel of malls shall not exit through anchor buildings. Malls terminating at an anchor building where other means of egress has not been provided shall be considered as a dead-end mall.

## 402.8.5 Distance to exits.
Within each individual tenant space in a covered or open mall building, the distance of travel from any point to an exit or entrance to the mall shall be not greater than 200 feet (60 960 mm).

The distance of travel from any point within a mall of a covered mall building to an exit shall be not greater than 200 feet (60 960 mm). The maximum distance of travel from any point within an open mall to the perimeter line of the open mall building shall be not greater than 200 feet (60 960 mm).

## 402.8.6 Access to exits.
Where more than one exit is required, they shall be so arranged that it is possible to travel in either direction from any point in a mall of a covered mall building to separate exits or from any point in an open mall of an open mall building to two separate locations on the perimeter line, provided that neither location is an exterior wall of an anchor building or parking garage. The width of an exit passageway or corridor from a mall shall be not less than 66 inches (1676 mm).

**Exception:** Access to exits is permitted by way of a dead-end mall that does not exceed a length equal to twice the width of the mall measured at the narrowest location within the dead-end portion of the mall.

### 402.8.6.1 Exit passageways.
Where exit passageways provide a secondary means of egress from a tenant space, the exit passageways shall be constructed in accordance with Section 1024.

## 402.8.7 Service areas fronting on exit passageways.
Mechanical rooms, electrical rooms, building service areas and service elevators are permitted to open directly into exit passageways, provided that the exit passageway is separated from such rooms with not less than 1-hour fire barriers constructed in accordance with Section 707 or horizontal assemblies constructed in accordance with Section 711, or both.

# GENERAL BUILDING HEIGHTS AND AREAS

## TABLE 506.2—continued
### ALLOWABLE AREA FACTOR (A<sub>t</sub> = NS, S1, S13R, S13D or SM, as applicable) IN SQUARE FEET<sup>a, b</sup>

For SI: 1 square foot = 0.0929 m<sup>2</sup>.

UL = Unlimited; NP = Not Permitted; NS = Buildings not equipped throughout with an automatic sprinkler system; S1 = Buildings a maximum of one story above grade plane equipped throughout with an automatic sprinkler system installed in accordance with Section 903.3.1.1; SM = Buildings two or more stories above grade plane equipped throughout with an automatic sprinkler system installed in accordance with Section 903.3.1.1; S13R = Buildings equipped throughout with an automatic sprinkler system installed in accordance with Section 903.3.1.2; S13D = Buildings equipped throughout with an automatic sprinkler system installed in accordance with Section 903.3.1.3.

a. See Chapters 4 and 5 for specific exceptions to the allowable height in this chapter.
b. See Section 903.2 for the minimum thresholds for protection by an automatic sprinkler system for specific occupancies.
c. New Group H occupancies are required to be protected by an automatic sprinkler system in accordance with Section 903.2.5.
d. The NS value is only for use in evaluation of existing building area in accordance with the International Existing Building Code.
e. New Group I-1 and I-3 occupancies are required to be protected by an automatic sprinkler system in accordance with Section 903.2.6. For new Group I-1 occupancies, Condition 1, see Exception 1 of Section 903.2.6.
f. New and existing Group I-2 occupancies are required to be protected by an automatic sprinkler system in accordance with Section 903.2.6 and Section 1103.5 of the International Fire Code.

i. The maximum allowable area for a single-story nonsprinklered Group U greenhouse is permitted to be 9,000 square feet, or the allowable area shall be permitted to comply with Table C102.1 of Appendix C.

### 506.3.2 Minimum frontage distance.
To qualify for an area factor increase based on frontage, the public way or open space adjacent to the building perimeter shall have a minimum distance (W) of 20 feet (6096 mm) measured at right angles from the building face to any of the following:

1. The closest interior lot line.
2. The entire width of a street, alley or public way.
3. The exterior face of an adjacent building on the same property.

Where the value of W is greater than 30 feet (9144 mm), a value of 30 feet (9144 mm) shall be used in calculating the building area increase based on frontage, regardless of the actual width of the public way or open space. Where the value of W varies along the perimeter of the building, the calculation performed in accordance with Equation 5-5 shall be based on the weighted average calculated in accordance with Equation 5-4.

W = (L<sub>1</sub> × w<sub>1</sub> + L<sub>2</sub> × w<sub>2</sub> + L<sub>3</sub> × w<sub>3</sub>…)/F (Equation 5-4)

where:
W (Width: weighted average) = Calculated width of public way or open space (feet).
L<sub>n</sub> = Length of a portion of the exterior perimeter wall.
w<sub>n</sub> = Width (≥ 20 feet) of a public way or open space associated with that portion of the exterior perimeter wall.
F = Building perimeter that fronts on a public way or open space having a width of 20 feet (6096 mm) or more.

Exception: Where a building meets the requirements of Section 507, as applicable, except for compliance with the minimum 60-foot (18 288 mm) public way or yard requirement, and the value of W is greater than 30 feet (9144 mm), the value of W shall not exceed 60 feet (18 288 mm).

### 506.3.3 Amount of increase.
The area factor increase based on frontage shall be determined in accordance with Equation 5-5:

I<sub>f</sub> = [F/P - 0.25]W/30 (Equation 5-5)

where:
I<sub>f</sub> = Area factor increase due to frontage.
F = Building perimeter that fronts on a public way or open space having minimum distance of 20 feet (6096 mm).
P = Perimeter of entire building (feet).
W = Width of public way or open space (feet) in accordance with Section 506.3.2.

## SECTION 507
### UNLIMITED AREA BUILDINGS

507.1 General. The area of buildings of the occupancies and configurations specified in Sections 507.1 through 507.13 shall not be limited. Basements not more than one story below grade plane shall be permitted.

507.1.1 Accessory occupancies. Accessory occupancies shall be permitted in unlimited area buildings in accordance with the provisions of Section 508.2, otherwise the requirements of Sections 507.3 through 507.13 shall be applied, where applicable.

507.2 Measurement of open spaces. Where Sections 507.3 through 507.13 require buildings to be surrounded and adjoined by public ways and yards, those open spaces shall be determined as follows:

1. Yards shall be measured from the building perimeter in all directions to the closest interior lot lines or to the exterior face of an opposing building located on the same lot, as applicable.

2. Where the building fronts on a public way, the entire width of the public way shall be used.

## SECTION 509
### INCIDENTAL USES

**509.1 General** Incidental uses located within single occupancy or mixed occupancy buildings shall comply with the provisions of this section. Incidental uses are ancillary functions associated with a given occupancy that generally pose a greater level of risk to that occupancy and are limited to those uses listed in Table 509.

**Exception:** Incidental uses within and serving a *dwelling unit* are not required to comply with this section.

**509.2 Occupancy classification.** Incidental uses shall not be individually classified in accordance with Section 302.1. Incidental uses shall be included in the building occupancies within which they are located.

**509.3 Area limitations.** Incidental uses shall not occupy more than 10 percent of the *building area* of the *story* in which they are located.

**509.4 Separation and protection.** The incidental uses listed in Table 509 shall be separated from the remainder of the building or equipped with an *automatic sprinkler system*, or both, in accordance with the provisions of that table.

**509.4.1 Separation.** Where Table 509 specifies a fire-resistance-rated separation, the incidental uses shall be separated from the remainder of the building by a *fire barrier* constructed in accordance with Section 707 or a *horizontal assembly* constructed in accordance with Section 711, or both. Construction supporting 1-hour *fire barriers* or *horizontal assemblies* used for incidental use separations in buildings of Type IIB, IIIB and VB construction is not required to be fire-resistance rated unless required by other sections of this code.

**509.4.2 Protection.** Where Table 509 permits an *automatic sprinkler system* without a *fire barrier*, the incidental uses shall be separated from the remainder of the building by construction capable of resisting the passage of smoke. The walls shall extend from the top of the foundation or floor assembly below to the underside of the ceiling that is a component of a fire-resistance-rated floor assembly or roof assembly above or to the underside of the floor or roof sheathing, deck or slab above. Doors shall be self- or automatic-closing upon detection of smoke in accordance with Section 716.2.6.6. Doors shall not have air transfer openings and shall not be undercut in excess of the clearance permitted in accordance with NFPA 80. Walls surrounding the incidental use shall not have air transfer openings unless provided with smoke dampers in accordance with Section 710.8.

**509.4.2.1 Protection limitation.** Where an *automatic sprinkler system* is provided in accordance with Table 509, only the space occupied by the incidental use need be equipped with such a system.

## SECTION 510
### SPECIAL PROVISIONS

**510.1 General.** The provisions in Sections 510.2 through 510.9 shall permit the use of special conditions that are exempt from, or modify, the specific requirements of this chapter regarding the allowable *building heights and areas* of

# CHAPTER 6

# TYPES OF CONSTRUCTION

User note:
    About this chapter: Chapter 6 establishes five types of construction in which each building must be categorized. This chapter looks at the
    materials used in the building (combustible or noncombustible) and the extent to which building elements such as building frame, roof, wall
    and floor can resist fire. Depending on the type of construction, the specific building element and its proximity to a lot line, fire resistance of 1
    to 3 hours is specified.

## SECTION 601
### GENERAL
601.1 Scope. The provisions of this chapter shall control the
classification of buildings as to type of construction.

## SECTION 602
### CONSTRUCTION CLASSIFICATION
602.1 General. Buildings and structures erected or to be
erected, altered or extended in height or area shall be classi-
fied in one of the five construction types defined in Sections
602.2 through 602.5. The building elements shall have a fire-
resistance rating not less than that specified in Table 601 and
exterior walls shall have a fire-resistance rating not less than
that specified in Table 602. Where required to have a fire-
resistance rating by Table 601, building elements shall com-
ply with the applicable provisions of Section 703.2. The pro-
tection of openings, ducts and air transfer openings in
building elements shall not be required unless required by
other provisions of this code.

602.1.1 Minimum requirements. A building or portion
thereof shall not be required to conform to the details of a
type of construction higher than that type which meets the
minimum requirements based on occupancy even though
certain features of such a building actually conform to a
higher type of construction.

602.2 Types I and II. Types I and II construction are those
types of construction in which the building elements listed in
Table 601 are of noncombustible materials, except as permit-
ted in Section 603 and elsewhere in this code.

602.3 Type III. Type III construction is that type of construc-
tion in which the exterior walls are of noncombustible materi-
als and the interior building elements are of any material
permitted by this code. Fire-retardant-treated wood framing
and sheathing complying with Section 2303.2 shall be per-
mitted within exterior wall assemblies of a 2-hour rating or
less.

602.4 Type IV. Type IV construction is that type of con-
struction in which the exterior walls are of noncombustible

# CHAPTER 7

# FIRE AND SMOKE PROTECTION FEATURES

User note:
    About this chapter: Chapter 7 provides detailed requirements for fire-resistance-rated construction, including structural members, walls, partitions
    and horizontal assemblies. Other portions of the code describe where certain fire-resistance-rated elements are required. This chapter specifies
    how these elements are constructed, how openings in walls and partitions are protected and how penetrations of such elements are protected.

## SECTION 701
### GENERAL

701.1 Scope. The provisions of this chapter shall govern the
materials, systems and assemblies used for structural fire
resistance and fire-resistance-rated construction separation of
adjacent spaces to safeguard against the spread of fire and
smoke within a building and the spread of fire to or from
buildings.

## SECTION 702
### MULTIPLE USE FIRE ASSEMBLIES

702.1 Multiple use fire assemblies. Fire assemblies that
serve multiple purposes in a building shall comply with all of
the requirements that are applicable for each of the individual
fire assemblies.

## SECTION 703
### FIRE-RESISTANCE RATINGS AND FIRE TESTS

703.1 Scope. Materials prescribed herein for fire resistance
shall conform to the requirements of this chapter.

703.2 Fire-resistance ratings. The fire-resistance rating of
building elements, components or assemblies shall be determined in accordance with the test procedures set forth in
ASTM E119 or UL 263 or in accordance with Section 703.3.
The fire-resistance rating of penetrations and fire-resistant
joint systems shall be determined in accordance Sections 714
and 715, respectively.

703.2.1 Nonsymmetrical wall construction. Interior
walls and partitions of nonsymmetrical construction shall
be tested with both faces exposed to the furnace, and the
assigned fire-resistance rating shall be the shortest duration obtained from the two tests conducted in compliance
with ASTM E119 or UL 263. Where evidence is furnished
to show that the wall was tested with the least fire-resistant
side exposed to the furnace, subject to acceptance of the
building official, the wall need not be subjected to tests
from the opposite side (see Section 705.5 for exterior
walls).

703.2.2 Combustible components. Combustible aggregates are permitted in gypsum and Portland cement concrete mixtures for fire-resistance-rated construction. Any
component material or admixture is permitted in assemblies if the resulting tested assembly meets the fire-resistance test requirements of this code.

703.2.3 Restrained classification. Fire-resistance-rated
assemblies tested under ASTM E119 or UL 263 shall not
be considered to be restrained unless evidence satisfactory
to the building official is furnished by the registered
design professional showing that the construction qualifies
for a restrained classification in accordance with ASTM
E119 or UL 263. Restrained construction shall be identified on the construction documents.

703.2.4 Supplemental features. Where materials, systems or devices that have not been tested as part of a fire-
resistance-rated assembly are incorporated into the building element, component or assembly, sufficient data shall
be made available to the building official to show that the
required fire-resistance rating is not reduced.

703.2.5 Exterior bearing walls. In determining the fire-
resistance rating of exterior bearing walls, compliance
with the ASTM E119 or UL 263 criteria for unexposed
surface temperature rise and ignition of cotton waste due
to passage of flame or gases is required only for a period
of time corresponding to the required fire-resistance rating of an exterior nonbearing wall with the same fire separation distance, and in a building of the same group.
Where the fire-resistance rating determined in accordance
with this exception exceeds the fire-resistance rating
determined in accordance with ASTM E119 or UL 263,
the fire exposure time period, water pressure and application duration criteria for the hose stream test of ASTM
E119 or UL 263 shall be based on the fire-resistance rating determined in accordance with this section.

703.3 Methods for determining fire resistance. The application of any of the methods listed in this section shall be
based on the fire exposure and acceptance criteria specified in
ASTM E119 or UL 263. The required fire resistance of a
building element, component or assembly shall be permitted
to be established by any of the following methods or procedures:

1. Fire-resistance designs documented in approved
sources.

2. Prescriptive designs of fire-resistance-rated building
elements, components or assemblies as prescribed in
Section 721.

3. Calculations in accordance with Section 722.

4. Engineering analysis based on a comparison of building element, component or assemblies designs having
fire-resistance ratings as determined by the test procedures set forth in ASTM E119 or UL 263.

5. Alternative protection methods as allowed by Section
   104.11.

6. Fire-resistance designs certified by an approved
   agency.

703.4 Automatic sprinklers. Under the prescriptive fire-
resistance requirements of this code, the fire-resistance rating
of a building element, component or assembly shall be estab-
lished without the use of automatic sprinklers or any other
fire suppression system being incorporated as part of the
assembly tested in accordance with the fire exposure, proce-
dures and acceptance criteria specified in ASTM E119 or UL
263. However, this section shall not prohibit or limit the
duties and powers of the building official allowed by Sections
104.10 and 104.11.

703.5 Noncombustibility tests. The tests indicated in Sec-
tions 703.5.1 and 703.5.2 shall serve as criteria for accep-
tance of building materials as set forth in Sections 602.2,
602.3 and 602.4 in Types I, II, III and IV construction. The
term "noncombustible" does not apply to the flame spread
characteristics of interior finish or trim materials. A material
shall not be classified as a noncombustible building construc-
tion material if it is subject to an increase in combustibility or
flame spread beyond the limitations herein established
through the effects of age, moisture or other atmospheric con-
ditions.

703.5.1 Elementary materials. Materials required to be
noncombustible shall be tested in accordance with ASTM
E136.

703.5.2 Composite materials. Materials having a struc-
tural base of noncombustible material as determined in
accordance with Section 703.5.1 with a surfacing not more
than 0.125 inch (3.18 mm) thick that has a flame spread
index not greater than 50 when tested in accordance with
ASTM E84 or UL 723 shall be acceptable as noncombus-
tible materials.

703.6 Fire-resistance-rated glazing. Fire-resistance-rated
glazing, when tested in accordance with ASTM E119 or UL
263 and complying with the requirements of Section 707,
shall be permitted. Fire-resistance-rated glazing shall bear a
label marked in accordance with Table 716.1(1) issued by an
agency and shall be permanently identified on the glazing.

703.7 Marking and identification. Where there is an acces-
sible concealed floor, floor-ceiling or attic space, fire walls,
fire barriers, fire partitions, smoke barriers and smoke parti-
tions or any other wall required to have protected openings or
penetrations shall be effectively and permanently identified
with signs or stenciling in the concealed space. Such identifi-
cation shall:

1. Be located within 15 feet (4572 mm) of the end of each
   wall and at intervals not exceeding 30 feet (9144 mm)
   measured horizontally along the wall or partition.

2. Include lettering not less than 3 inches (76 mm) in
   height with a minimum 3/8-inch (9.5 mm) stroke in a
   contrasting color incorporating the suggested wording,
   "FIRE AND/OR SMOKE BARRIER—PROTECT
   ALL OPENINGS," or other wording.

# SECTION 704

the structural frame, regardless of span.

**704.12 Seismic isolation systems.** Fire-resistance ratings for
the isolation system shall meet the fire-resistance rating
required for the columns, walls or other structural elements in
which the isolation system is installed in accordance with
Table 601. Isolation systems required to have a fire-resis-
tance rating shall be protected with approved materials or
construction assemblies designed to provide the same degree
of fire resistance as the structural element in which the sys-
tem is installed when tested in accordance with ASTM E119
or UL 263 (see Section 703.2).

tested in accordance with the requirements of either ASTM
E1966 or UL 2079. Nonsymmetrical wall joint systems shall
be tested with both faces exposed to the furnace, and the
assigned fire-resistance rating shall be the shortest duration
obtained from the two tests. Where evidence is furnished to
show that the wall was tested with the least fire-resistant side
exposed to the furnace, subject to acceptance of the building
official, the wall need not be subjected to tests from the oppo-
site side.

**Exception:** For exterior walls with a horizontal fire separa-
tion distance greater than 10 feet (3048 mm), the joint sys-
tem shall be required to be tested for interior fire exposure

drels shall comply with Section 705.8.5.

**Exception:** Voids created at the intersection of the exte-
rior curtain wall assemblies and such floor assemblies
where the vision glass extends to the finished floor level
shall be permitted to be sealed with an approved material
to prevent the interior spread of fire. Such material shall be
securely installed and capable of preventing the passage of
flame and hot gases sufficient to ignite cotton waste where
subjected to ASTM E119 time-temperature fire conditions
under a minimum positive pressure differential of 0.01
inch (0.254 mm) of water column (2.5 Pa) for the time
period not less than the fire-resistance rating of the floor
assembly.

**715.4.1 Exterior curtain wall/nonfire-resistance-rated
floor assembly intersections.** Voids created at the inter-
section of exterior curtain wall assemblies and nonfire-
resistance-rated floor or floor/ceiling assemblies shall be
sealed with an approved material or system to retard the
interior spread of fire and hot gases between stories.

**715.4.2 Exterior curtain wall/vertical fire barrier inter-
sections.** Voids created at the intersection of nonfire-resis-
tance-rated exterior curtain wall assemblies and fire
barriers shall be filled. An approved material or system
shall be used to fill the void and shall be securely installed
in or on the intersection for its entire length so as not to

**Exception:** Insulation and covering on pipe and tubing
installed in plenums shall comply with the *International
Mechanical Code*.

## SECTION 721
PRESCRIPTIVE FIRE RESISTANCE

**721.1 General.** The provisions of this section contain pre-
scriptive details of fire-resistance-rated building elements,
components or assemblies. The materials of construction
listed in Tables 721.1(1), 721.1(2) and 721.1(3) shall be
assumed to have the *fire-resistance ratings* prescribed
therein. Where materials that change the capacity for heat dis-
sipation are incorporated into a fire-resistance-rated assem-
bly, fire test results or other substantiating data shall be made
available to the *building official* to show that the required
*fire-resistance-rating* time period is not reduced.

**721.1.1 Thickness of protective coverings.** The thickness
of fire-resistant materials required for protection of struc-
tural members shall be not less than set forth in Table
721.1(1), except as modified in this section. The figures
shown shall be the net thickness of the protecting materials
and shall not include any hollow space in back of the pro-
tection.

**721.1.2 Unit masonry protection.** Where required, metal
ties shall be embedded in bed joints of unit masonry for
protection of steel columns. Such ties shall be as set forth
in Table 721.1(1) or be equivalent thereto.

**721.1.3 Reinforcement for cast-in-place concrete col-
umn protection.** Cast-in-place concrete protection for
steel columns shall be reinforced at the edges of such
members with wire ties of not less than 0.18 inch (4.6 mm)
in diameter wound spirally around the columns on a pitch
of not more than 8 inches (203 mm) or by equivalent rein-
forcement.

**721.1.4 Plaster application.** The finish coat is not
required for plaster protective coatings where those coat-
ings comply with the design mix and thickness require-
ments of Tables 721.1(1), 721.1(2) and 721.1(3).

**721.1.5 Bonded prestressed concrete tendons.** For mem-
bers having a single tendon or more than one tendon
installed with equal concrete cover measured from the
nearest surface, the cover shall be not less than that set
forth in Table 721.1(1). For members having multiple ten-
dons installed with variable concrete cover, the average

tendon cover shall be not less than that set forth in Table
721.1(1), provided that:

1. The clearance from each tendon to the nearest
exposed surface is used to determine the average
cover.

2. The clear cover for individual tendons shall not be
less than one-half of that set forth in Table 721.1(1).
A minimum cover of 3/4 inch (19.1 mm) for slabs
and 1 inch (25 mm) for beams is required for any
aggregate concrete.

3. For the purpose of establishing a *fire-resistance rat-
ing*, tendons having a clear covering less than that
set forth in Table 721.1(1) shall not contribute more
than 50 percent of the required ultimate moment
capacity for members less than 350 square inches
(0.226 m²) in cross-sectional area and 65 percent for
larger members. For structural design purposes,
however, tendons having a reduced cover are
assumed to be fully effective.

## SECTION 722
CALCULATED FIRE RESISTANCE

**722.1 General.** The provisions of this section contain pro-
cedures by which the *fire resistance* of specific materials
or combinations of materials is established by calcula-
tions. These procedures apply only to the information con-
tained in this section and shall not be otherwise used. The
calculated *fire resistance* of concrete, concrete masonry
and clay masonry assemblies shall be permitted in accor-
dance with ACI 216.1/TMS 0216. The calculated *fire
resistance* of steel assemblies shall be permitted in accor-
dance with Chapter 5 of ASCE 29. The calculated *fire
resistance* of exposed wood members and wood decking
shall be permitted in accordance with Chapter 16 of ANSI/
AWC *National Design Specification for Wood Construc-
tion (NDS)*.

**722.2 Concrete assemblies.** The provisions of this section
contain procedures by which the *fire-resistance ratings* of
concrete assemblies are established by calculations.

**722.2.1 Concrete walls.** Cast-in-place and precast con-
crete walls shall comply with Section 722.2.1.1. Multi-
wythe concrete walls shall comply with Section 722.2.1.2.
Joints between precast panels shall comply with Section
722.2.1.3. Concrete walls with gypsum wallboard or plas-
ter finish shall comply with Section 722.2.1.4.

**722.2.1.1 Cast-in-place or precast walls.** The mini-
mum equivalent thicknesses of cast-in-place or precast
concrete walls for *fire-resistance ratings* of 1 hour to 4
hours are shown in Table 722.2.1.1. For solid walls
with flat vertical surfaces, the equivalent thickness is
the same as the actual thickness. The values in Table
722.2.1.1 apply to plain, reinforced or prestressed con-
crete walls.

This image shows a portion of Table 721.1(2) from the International Building Code, which provides rated fire-resistance periods for various walls and partitions. The table details different construction methods for exterior and interior walls, along with their corresponding fire resistance ratings.

Key points from the table:

1. Item 15-1.5m describes a wall construction using clay face brick, gypsum sheathing, wood studs, and Type X gypsum wallboard. This construction achieves a 2-hour fire resistance rating with a 10-inch minimum finished thickness.

2. Item 15-1.6l,m outlines a construction using fire-retardant-treated wood studs, multiple layers of Type X gypsum, exterior lath, and cement plaster. This assembly provides a 2-hour fire resistance rating with an 8 3/4 inch minimum finished thickness.

3. Item 15-1.7l,m details another wall assembly using wood studs, gypsum sheathing, exterior lath, cement plaster, and interior gypsum lath with wire mesh. This construction also achieves a 2-hour fire resistance rating with an 8 3/8 inch minimum finished thickness.

The table provides specific information on materials, fastening methods, plaster mixes, and construction techniques required to achieve the stated fire resistance ratings. This information is crucial for architects, engineers, and builders to ensure proper fire protection in building design and construction.

# FIRE AND SMOKE PROTECTION FEATURES

## 722.2.1.1.1 Hollow-core precast wall panels.
For hollow-core precast concrete wall panels in which the cores are of constant cross section throughout the length, calculation of the equivalent thickness by dividing the net cross-sectional area (the gross cross section minus the area of the cores) of the panel by its width shall be permitted.

### TABLE 722.2.1.1
#### MINIMUM EQUIVALENT THICKNESS OF CAST-IN-PLACE OR PRECAST CONCRETE WALLS, LOAD-BEARING OR NONLOAD-BEARING

| CONCRETE TYPE | MINIMUM SLAB THICKNESS (inches) FOR FIRE-RESISTANCE RATING OF |||||
|---------------|:-----:|:----------:|:-------:|:-------:|:-------:|
|               | 1 hour | 1 1/2 hours | 2 hours | 3 hours | 4 hours |
| Siliceous     | 3.5   | 4.3        | 5.0     | 6.2     | 7.0     |
| Carbonate     | 3.2   | 4.0        | 4.6     | 5.7     | 6.6     |
| Sand-lightweight | 2.7 | 3.3        | 3.8     | 4.6     | 5.4     |
| Lightweight   | 2.5   | 3.1        | 3.6     | 4.4     | 5.1     |

For SI: 1 inch = 25.4 mm.

### 722.2.1.1.2 Core spaces filled.
Where all of the core spaces of hollow-core wall panels are filled with loose-fill material, such as expanded shale, clay or slag, or vermiculite or perlite, the fire-resistance rating of the wall is the same as that of a solid wall of the same concrete type and of the same overall thickness.

### 722.2.1.1.3 Tapered cross sections.
The thickness of panels with tapered cross sections shall be that determined at a distance 2t or 6 inches (152 mm), whichever is less, from the point of minimum thickness, where t is the minimum thickness.

### 722.2.1.1.4 Ribbed or undulating surfaces.
The equivalent thickness of panels with ribbed or undulating surfaces shall be determined by one of the following expressions:

For s ≥ 4t, the thickness to be used shall be t
For s ≤ 2t, the thickness to be used shall be te
For 4t > s > 2t, the thickness to be used shall be

t + (4t/s - 1)(te - t)                    (Equation 7-3)

where:
s = Spacing of ribs or undulations.
t = Minimum thickness.
te = Equivalent thickness of the panel calculated as the net cross-sectional area of the panel divided by the width, in which the maximum thickness used in the calculation shall not exceed 2t.

## 722.2.1.2 Multiwythe walls.
For walls that consist of two wythes of different types of concrete, the fire-resistance ratings shall be permitted to be determined from Figure 722.2.1.2.

### 722.2.1.2.1 Two or more wythes.
The fire-resistance rating for wall panels consisting of two or more wythes shall be permitted to be determined by the formula:

R = (R1^0.59 + R2^0.59 +...+ Rn^0.59)^1.7    (Equation 7-4)

where:
R = The fire endurance of the assembly, minutes.
R1, R2, and Rn = The fire endurances of the individual wythes, minutes. Values of Rn^0.59 for use in Equation 7-4 are given in Table 722.2.1.2(1). Calculated fire-resistance ratings are shown in Table 722.2.1.2(2).

### 722.2.1.2.2 Foam plastic insulation.
The fire-resistance ratings of precast concrete wall panels consisting of a layer of foam plastic insulation sandwiched between two wythes of concrete shall be permitted to be determined by use of Equation 7-4. Foam plastic insulation with a total thickness of less than 1 inch (25 mm) shall be disregarded. The Rn value for thickness of foam plastic insulation of 1 inch (25 mm) or greater, for use in the calculation, is 5 minutes; therefore Rn^0.59 = 2.5.

## 722.2.1.3 Joints between precast wall panels.
Joints between precast concrete wall panels that are not insulated as required by this section shall be considered as openings in walls. Uninsulated joints shall be included in determining the percentage of openings permitted by Table 705.8. Where openings are not permitted or are required by this code to be protected, the provisions of this section shall be used to determine the amount of joint insulation required.

# FIRE AND SMOKE PROTECTION FEATURES

## 722.2.1.4 Walls with gypsum wallboard or plaster finishes.
The *fire-resistance rating* of cast-in-place or precast concrete walls with finishes of gypsum wallboard or plaster applied to one or both sides shall be permitted to be calculated in accordance with the provisions of this section.

### 722.2.1.4.1 Nonfire-exposed side.
Where the finish of gypsum wallboard or plaster is applied to the side of the wall not exposed to fire, the contribution of the finish to the total *fire-resistance rating* shall be determined as follows: The thickness of the finish shall first be corrected by multiplying the actual thickness of the finish by the applicable factor determined from Table 722.2.1.4(1) based on the type of aggregate in the concrete. The corrected thickness of finish shall then be added to the actual or equivalent thickness of concrete and *fire-resistance rating* determined from Tables 722.2.1.1 and 722.2.1.2(1) and Figure 722.2.1.2.

### 722.2.1.4.2 Fire-exposed side.
Where gypsum wallboard or plaster is applied to the fire-exposed side of the wall, the contribution of the finish to the total *fire-resistance rating* shall be determined as follows: The time assigned to the finish as established by Table 722.2.1.4(2) shall be added to the *fire-resistance rating* determined from Tables 722.2.1.1 and 722.2.1.2(1) and Figure 722.2.1.2 for the concrete alone, or to the rating determined in Section 722.2.1.4.1 for the concrete and finish on the nonfire-exposed side.

### 722.2.1.4.3 Nonsymmetrical assemblies.
For a wall without finish on one side or having different types or thicknesses of finish on each side, the calculation procedures of Sections 722.2.1.4.1 and 722.2.1.4.2 shall be performed twice, assuming either side of the wall to be the fire-exposed side. The *fire-resistance rating* of the wall shall not exceed the lower of the two values.

**Exception:** For an *exterior wall* with a *fire separation distance* greater than 5 feet (1524 mm) the fire shall be assumed to occur on the interior side only.

### 722.2.1.4.4 Minimum concrete fire-resistance rating.
Where finishes applied to one or both sides of a concrete wall contribute to the *fire-resistance rating*, the concrete alone shall provide not less than one-half of the total required *fire-resistance rating*. Additionally, the contribution to the *fire resistance* of the finish on the nonfire-exposed side of a *load-bearing wall* shall not exceed one-half the contribution of the concrete alone.

### 722.2.1.4.5 Concrete finishes.
Finishes on concrete walls that are assumed to contribute to the total *fire-resistance rating* of the wall shall comply with the installation requirements of Section 722.3.2.5.

As used in these sections, W is the average weight of a structural steel column in pounds per linear foot. The heated perimeter, D, is the inside perimeter of the fire-resistant material in inches as illustrated in Figure 722.5.1(1).

[Figure 722.5.1(1) showing determination of heated perimeter for various column shapes]

shall be permitted to be determined from the following expression:

R = 130 [h(W'/D)/2]^0.75 (Equation 7-12)

where:
R = Fire resistance (minutes).
h = Total thickness of gypsum wallboard (inches).
D = Heated perimeter of the structural steel column (inches).
W' = Total weight of the structural steel column and gypsum wallboard protection (pounds per linear foot).
W' = W + 50hD/144.

Where dissimilar membranes are used on a wall assembly that requires consideration of fire exposure from both sides, the calculation shall be made from the least fire-resistant (weaker) side.

### 722.6.2 Walls, floors and roofs.
These procedures apply to both load-bearing and nonload-bearing assemblies.

#### 722.6.2.1 Fire-resistance rating of wood frame assemblies.
The fire-resistance rating of a wood frame assembly is equal to the sum of the time assigned to the membrane on the fire-exposed side, the time assigned to the framing members and the time assigned for additional contribution by other protective measures such as insulation. The membrane on the unexposed side shall not be included in determining the fire resistance of the assembly.

#### 722.6.2.2 Time assigned to membranes.
Table 722.6.2(1) indicates the time assigned to membranes on the fire-exposed side.

#### 722.6.2.3 Exterior walls.
For an exterior wall with a fire separation distance greater than 10 feet (3048 mm), the wall is assigned a rating dependent on the interior membrane and the framing as described in Tables 722.6.2(1) and 722.6.2(2). The membrane on the outside of the nonfire-exposed side of exterior walls with a fire separation distance greater than 10 feet (3048 mm) shall consist of sheathing, sheathing paper and siding as described in Table 722.6.2(3).

#### 722.6.2.4 Floors and roofs.
In the case of a floor or roof, the standard test provides only for testing for fire exposure from below. Except as noted in Section 703.3, Item 5, floor or roof assemblies of wood framing shall have an upper membrane consisting of a subfloor and finished floor conforming to Table 722.6.2(4) or any other membrane that has a contribution to fire resistance of not less than 15 minutes in Table 722.6.2(1).

#### 722.6.2.5 Additional protection.
Table 722.6.2(5) indicates the time increments to be added to the fire resistance where glass fiber, rockwool, slag mineral wool or cellulose insulation is incorporated in the assembly.

#### 722.6.2.6 Fastening.
Fastening of wood frame assemblies and the fastening of membranes to the wood framing members shall be done in accordance with Chapter 23.

The image shows Table 722.5.1(6) titled "FIRE RESISTANCE OF CLAY MASONRY PROTECTED STEEL COLUMNS" from the Fire and Smoke Protection Features section of what appears to be a building code document.

The table provides minimum required equivalent thickness values for fire-resistance ratings of clay masonry protection assemblies for various steel column sizes, steel tubing, and steel pipes. It is divided into three main sections:

1. Steel Columns: Lists various W-shaped column sizes (e.g., W14 x 82, W14 x 68, etc.) and provides thickness requirements for 1-hour, 2-hour, 3-hour, and 4-hour fire resistance ratings at clay masonry densities of 120 and 130 pounds per cubic foot.

2. Steel Tubing: Provides similar information for different nominal tube sizes with varying wall thicknesses.

3. Steel Pipe: Lists data for different nominal pipe sizes and wall thicknesses.

The table includes a wide range of column, tube, and pipe sizes, giving the minimum required equivalent thickness (Te) in inches for each fire-resistance rating category.

At the bottom of the table, there's a note for SI (International System) unit conversion: 1 inch = 25.4 mm, 1 pound per cubic foot = 16.02 kg/m³.

This table is likely used by architects, engineers, and building code officials to determine the appropriate clay masonry protection needed for steel structural elements to achieve specific fire-resistance ratings in building construction.

# CHAPTER 8

# INTERIOR FINISHES

User notes:
   About this chapter: Chapter 8 contains the performance requirements for controlling fire growth and smoke propagation within buildings by
   restricting interior finish and decorative materials. The provisions of this chapter require materials used as interior finishes and decorations to
   meet certain flame spread index or flame propagation criteria and smoke development criteria based on the relative fire hazard associated
   with the occupancy. The performance of the material is evaluated based on test standards.
   Code development reminder: Code change proposals to sections preceded by the designation [F] will be considered by the International
   Fire Code Development Committee during the 2019 (Group B) Code Development Cycle. See explanation on page iv.

## SECTION 801
## SCOPE

801.1 Scope. The provisions of this chapter shall govern the
use of materials used as interior finishes, trim and decorative
materials.

## SECTION 802
## GENERAL

802.1 Interior wall and ceiling finish. The provisions of
Section 803 shall limit the allowable fire performance and
smoke development of interior wall and ceiling finish materi-
als based on occupancy classification.

802.2 Interior floor finish. The provisions of Section 804
shall limit the allowable fire performance of interior floor fin-
ish materials based on occupancy classification.

[F] 802.3 Decorative materials and trim. Decorative mate-
rials and trim shall be restricted by combustibility, fire per-
formance or flame propagation performance criteria in
accordance with Section 806.

802.4 Applicability. For buildings in flood hazard areas as
established in Section 1612.3, interior finishes, trim and dec-
orative materials below the elevation required by Section
1612 shall be flood-damage-resistant materials.

802.5 Application. Combustible materials shall be permitted
to be used as finish for walls, ceilings, floors and other inte-
rior surfaces of buildings.

802.6 Windows. Show windows in the exterior walls of the
first story above grade plane shall be permitted to be of wood
or of unprotected metal framing.

802.7 Foam plastics. Foam plastics shall not be used as inte-
rior finish except as provided in Section 803.4. Foam plastics
shall not be used as interior trim except as provided in Sec-

   trolling or extinguishing the fire. Generally, the requirements are based on the occupancy, the height and the area of the building, because
   these are the factors that most affect fire-fighting capabilities and the relative hazard of a specific building or portion thereof. This chapter par-
   allels and is substantially duplicated in Chapter 9 of the International Fire Code®.

## SECTION 901

# CHAPTER 10

# MEANS OF EGRESS

User notes:
    About this chapter: Chapter 10 provides the general criteria for designing the means of egress established as the primary method for protection of people in buildings by allowing timely relocation or evacuation of building occupants. Both prescriptive and performance language is utilized in this chapter to provide for a basic approach in the determination of a safe exiting system for all occupancies. It addresses all portions of the egress system (exit access, exits and exit discharge) and includes design requirements as well as provisions regulating individual components. The requirements detail the size, arrangement, number and protection of means of egress components. Functional and operational characteristics that will permit the safe use of components without special knowledge or effort are specified.
    The means of egress protection requirements work in coordination with other sections of the code, such as protection of vertical openings (see Chapter 7), interior finish (see Chapter 8), fire suppression and detection systems (see Chapter 9) and numerous others, all having an impact on life safety. Chapter 10 is subdivided into four main sections: general (Sections 1003–1015), exit access (Sections 1016–1021), exit (Sections 1022–1027) and exit discharge (Section 1028). Special allowances for the unique requirements for assembly spaces (Section 1029) and emergency escape and rescue openings (Section 1030) complete the chapter. Chapter 10 of this code is duplicated in Chapter 10 of the International Fire Code®; however, the International Fire Code contains one additional section on maintenance of the means of egress system in existing buildings.
    Code development reminder: Code change proposals to sections preceded by the designation [F] will be considered by the International Fire Code Development Committee during the 2019 (Group B) Code Development Cycle. See explanation on page iv.

## SECTION 1001
## ADMINISTRATION

**1001.1 General.** Buildings or portions thereof shall be provided with a means of egress system as required by this chapter. The provisions of this chapter shall control the design, construction and arrangement of means of egress components required to provide an approved means of egress from structures and portions thereof.

**1001.2 Minimum requirements.** It shall be unlawful to alter a building or structure in a manner that will reduce the number of exits or the minimum width or required capacity of the means of egress to less than required by this code.

## [F] SECTION 1002

# MEANS OF EGRESS

## 1004.4 Multiple occupancies.
Where a building contains two or more occupancies, the *means of egress* requirements shall apply to each portion of the building based on the occupancy of that space. Where two or more occupancies utilize portions of the same *means of egress* system, those egress components shall meet the more stringent requirements of all occupancies that are served.

## 1004.5 Areas without fixed seating.
The number of occupants shall be computed at the rate of one occupant per unit of area as prescribed in Table 1004.5. For areas without *fixed seating*, the occupant load shall be not less than that number determined by dividing the floor area under consideration by the *occupant load* factor assigned to the function of the space as set forth in Table 1004.5. Where an intended function is not listed in Table 1004.5, the *building official* shall establish a function based on a listed function that most nearly resembles the intended function.

**Exception:** Where approved by the *building official*, the actual number of occupants for whom each occupied space, floor or building is designed, although less than those determined by calculation, shall be permitted to be used in the determination of the design *occupant load*.

### 1004.5.1 Increased occupant load.
The *occupant load* permitted in any building, or portion thereof, is permitted to be increased from that number established for the occupancies in Table 1004.5, provided that all other requirements of the code are met based on such modified number and the *occupant load* does not exceed one occupant per 7 square feet (0.65 m²) of occupiable floor space. Where required by the *building official*, an approved aisle, seating or fixed equipment diagram substantiating any increase in *occupant load* shall be submitted. Where required by the *building official*, such diagram shall be posted.

## 1004.6 Fixed seating.
For areas having *fixed seats* and aisles, the *occupant load* shall be determined by the number of *fixed seats* installed therein. The *occupant load* for areas in which *fixed seating* is not installed, such as waiting spaces, shall be determined in accordance with Section 1004.5 and added to the number of *fixed seats*.

The *occupant load* of wheelchair spaces and the associated companion seat shall be based on one occupant for each *wheelchair space* and one occupant for the associated companion seat provided in accordance with Section 1108.2.3.

For areas having *fixed seating* without dividing arms, the *occupant load* shall be not less than the number of seats based on one person for each 18 inches (457 mm) of seating length.

The *occupant load* of seating booths shall be based on one person for each 24 inches (610 mm) of booth seat length measured at the backrest of the seating booth.

## 1004.7 Outdoor areas.
Yards, patios, occupied roofs, courts and similar outdoor areas accessible to and usable by the building occupants shall be provided with *means of egress* as required by this chapter. The *occupant load* of such outdoor areas shall be assigned by the *building official* in accordance with the anticipated use.

# CHAPTER 11

# ACCESSIBILITY

User note:
    About this chapter: Chapter 11 contains provisions that set forth requirements for accessibility of buildings and their associated sites and
    facilities for people with physical disabilities. The fundamental philosophy of the code on the subject of accessibility is that everything is
    required to be accessible. This is reflected in the basic applicability requirement (see Section 1103.1). The code's scoping requirements then
    address the conditions under which accessibility is not required in terms of exceptions to this general mandate. While the IBC contains scop-
    ing provisions for accessibility (for example, what, where and how many), ICC A117.1, Accessible and Usable Buildings and Facilities, is the
    referenced standard for the technical provisions (in other words, how). Accessibility criteria for existing buildings are addressed in the Interna-
    tional Existing Building Code®. The International Residential Code® references Chapter 11 for accessibility provisions; therefore, this chapter
    may be applicable to housing covered under the International Residential Code. The provisions in the I-Codes are intended to meet or exceed
    the requirements in the federal accessibility requirement found in the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Fair Housing Act.
    There are many accessibility issues that not only benefit people with disabilities, but also provide a tangible benefit to people without disabili-
    ties. This type of requirement can be set forth in the code as generally applicable without necessarily identifying it specifically as an accessi-
    bility-related issue. Such a requirement would then be considered as having been "mainstreamed." For example, visible alarms are located in
    Chapter 9 and accessible means of egress and ramp requirements are addressed in Chapter 10.

## SECTION 1101

ers, fire towers or lifeguard stands are not required to com-
ply with this chapter.

**1103.2.7 Limited access spaces.** Spaces accessed only by
ladders, catwalks, crawl spaces, freight elevators or very
narrow passageways are not required to comply with this
chapter.

**1103.2.8 Areas in places of religious worship.** Raised or
lowered areas, or portions of areas, in *places of religious
worship* that are less than 300 square feet (30 m²) in area
and located 7 inches (178 mm) or more above or below the
finished floor and used primarily for the performance of

# CHAPTER 15

# ROOF ASSEMBLIES AND ROOFTOP STRUCTURES

User notes:
   About this chapter: Chapter 15 provides minimum requirements for the design and construction of roof assemblies and rooftop structures.
   The criteria address the weather-protective barrier at the roof and, in most circumstances, a fire-resistant barrier. The chapter is largely pre-
   scriptive in nature and is based on decades of experience with various traditional materials, but it also recognizes newer products such as
   photovoltaic shingles. Section 1510 addresses rooftop structures, which include penthouses, tanks, towers and spires. Rooftop penthouses
   larger than prescribed in this chapter must be treated as a story under Chapter 5.

   Code development reminder: Code change proposals to sections preceded by the designation [BF], [BG] or [P] will be considered by one of the
   code development committees meeting during the 2018 (Group A) Code Development Cycle. All other code change proposals will be considered
   by the IBC—Structural Code Development Committee during the 2019 (Group B) Code Development Cycle. See explanation on page iv.

# CHAPTER 16

# STRUCTURAL DESIGN

User notes:
   About this chapter: Chapter 16 establishes minimum design requirements so that the structural components of buildings are proportioned to
   resist the loads that are likely to be encountered. In addition, this chapter assigns buildings and structures to risk categories that are indicative
   of their intended use. The loads specified herein along with the required load combinations have been established through research and ser-
   vice performance of buildings and structures. The application of these loads and adherence to the serviceability criteria enhances the protec-
   tion of life and property.

For lumber and glued laminated timber members installed or used at all other moisture conditions or cross laminated timber and wood structural panels that are dry at time of installation and used under dry conditions in accordance with the ANSI/AWC NDS, the creep component of the long-term deflection is permitted to be estimated as the immediate dead load deflection resulting from D. The value of 0.5D shall not be used in combination with ANSI/AWC NDS provisions for long-term loading.
e. The preceding deflections do not ensure against ponding. Roofs that do not have sufficient slope or camber to ensure adequate drainage shall be investigated for ponding. See Chapter 8 of ASCE 7.
f. The wind load shall be permitted to be taken as 0.42 times the "component and cladding" loads or directly calculated using the 10-year mean return interval wind speed for the purpose of determining deflection limits in Table 1604.3. Where framing members support glass, the deflection limit therein shall not exceed that specified in Section 1604.3.7
g. For steel structural members, the deflection due to creep component of long-term dead load shall be permitted to be taken as zero.
h. For aluminum structural members or aluminum panels used in skylights and sloped glazing framing, roofs or walls of sunroom additions or patio covers not supporting edge of glass or aluminum sandwich panels, the total load deflection shall not exceed l/60. For continuous aluminum structural members supporting edge of glass, the total load deflection shall not exceed l/175 for each glass lite or l/60 for the entire length of the member, whichever is more stringent. For aluminum sandwich panels used in roofs or walls of sunroom additions or patio covers, the total load deflection shall not exceed 1/120.

1604.3.4 Masonry. The deflection of masonry structural members shall not exceed that permitted by TMS 402.

1604.3.5 Aluminum. The deflection of aluminum structural members shall not exceed that permitted by AA ADM1.

1604.3.6 Limits. The deflection limits of Section 1604.3.1 shall be used unless more restrictive deflection limits are required by a referenced standard for the element or finish material.

1604.4 Analysis. Load effects on structural members and their connections shall be determined by methods of structural analysis that take into account equilibrium, general stability, geometric compatibility and both short- and long-term material properties.

Members that tend to accumulate residual deformations under repeated service loads shall have included in their analysis the effects of added deformations expected to occur during their service life.

Any system or method of construction to be used shall be based on a rational analysis in accordance with well-established principles of mechanics. Such analysis shall result in a system that provides a complete load path capable of transferring loads from their point of origin to the load-resisting elements.

# STRUCTURAL DESIGN

The total lateral force shall be distributed to the various vertical elements of the lateral force-resisting system in proportion to their rigidities, considering the rigidity of the horizontal bracing system or diaphragm. Rigid elements assumed not to be a part of the lateral force-resisting system are permitted to be incorporated into buildings provided that their effect on the action of the system is considered and provided for in the design. A diaphragm is rigid for the purpose of distribution of story shear and torsional moment when the lateral deformation of the diaphragm is less than or equal to two times the average story drift. Where required by ASCE 7, provisions shall be made for the increased forces induced on resisting elements of the structural system resulting from torsion due to eccentricity between the center of application of the lateral forces and the center of rigidity of the lateral force-resisting system.

Every structure shall be designed to resist the effects caused by the forces specified in this chapter, including overturning, uplift and sliding. Where sliding is used to isolate the elements, the effects of friction between sliding elements shall be included as a force.

1604.5 Risk category. Each building and structure shall be assigned a risk category in accordance with Table 1604.5. Where a referenced standard specifies an occupancy category, the risk category shall not be taken as lower than the occupancy category specified therein. Where a referenced standard specifies that the assignment of a risk category be in accordance with ASCE 7, Table 1.5-1, Table 1604.5 shall be used in lieu of ASCE 7, Table 1.5-1.

Exception: The assignment of buildings and structures to Tsunami Risk Categories III and IV is permitted to be in accordance with Section 6.4 of ASCE 7.

### 1607.11.1 Basic uniform live load reduction.
Subject to the limitations of Sections 1607.11.1.1 through 1607.11.1.3 and Table 1607.1, members for which a value of KLL AT is 400 square feet (37.16 m²) or more are permitted to be designed for a reduced uniformly distributed live load, L, in accordance with the following equation:

L = Lo(0.25 + 15 / √(KLL AT))    (Equation 16-23)

For SI: L = Lo(0.25 + 4.57 / √(KLL AT))

where:

L = Reduced design live load per square foot (m²) of area supported by the member.
Lo = Unreduced design live load per square foot (m²) of area supported by the member (see Table 1607.1).
KLL = Live load element factor (see Table 1607.11.1).
AT = Tributary area, in square feet (m²).

L shall be not less than 0.50Lo for members supporting one floor and L shall be not less than 0.40Lo for members supporting two or more floors.

#### 1607.11.1.1 One-way slabs.
The tributary area, AT, for use in Equation 16-23 for one-way slabs shall not exceed an area defined by the slab span times a width normal to the span of 1.5 times the slab span.

#### 1607.11.1.2 Heavy live loads.
Live loads that exceed 100 psf (4.79 kN/m²) shall not be reduced.

**Exceptions:**
1. The live loads for members supporting two or more floors are permitted to be reduced by not greater than 20 percent, but the live load shall be not less than L as calculated in Section 1607.11.1.

### 1607.11.2 Alternative uniform live load reduction.
As an alternative to Section 1607.11.1 and subject to the limitations of Table 1607.1, uniformly distributed live loads are permitted to be reduced in accordance with the following provisions. Such reductions shall apply to slab systems, beams, girders, columns, piers, walls and foundations.

1. A reduction shall not be permitted where the live load exceeds 100 psf (4.79 kN/m²) except that the design live load for members supporting two or more floors is permitted to be reduced by not greater than 20 percent.

   **Exception:** For uses other than storage, where approved, additional live load reductions shall be permitted where shown by the registered design professional that a rational approach has been used and that such reductions are warranted.

2. A reduction shall not be permitted in passenger vehicle parking garages except that the live loads for members supporting two or more floors are permitted to be reduced by not greater than 20 percent.

3. For live loads not exceeding 100 psf (4.79 kN/m²), the design live load for any structural member supporting 150 square feet (13.94 m²) or more is permitted to be reduced in accordance with Equation 16-24.

4. For one-way slabs, the area, A, for use in Equation 16-24 shall not exceed the product of the slab span and a width normal to the span of 0.5 times the slab span.

R = 0.08(A - 150)    (Equation 16-24)

For SI: R = 0.861(A - 13.94)

Such reduction shall not exceed the smallest of:
1. 40 percent for members supporting one floor.

# STRUCTURAL DESIGN

2. 60 percent for members supporting two or more floors.
3. R as determined by the following equation:

R = 23.1(1+ D/Lo)                          (Equation 16-25)

where:
A = Area of floor supported by the member, square feet (m²).
D = Dead load per square foot (m²) of area supported.
Lo = Unreduced live load per square foot (m²) of area supported.
R = Reduction in percent.

## 1607.12 Distribution of floor loads.
Where uniform floor live loads are involved in the design of structural members arranged so as to create continuity, the minimum applied loads shall be the full dead loads on all spans in combination with the floor live loads on spans selected to produce the greatest load effect at each location under consideration. Floor live loads are permitted to be reduced in accordance with Section 1607.11.

## 1607.13 Roof loads.
The structural supports of roofs and marquees shall be designed to resist wind and, where applicable, snow and earthquake loads, in addition to the dead load of construction and the appropriate live loads as prescribed in this section, or as set forth in Table 1607.1. The live loads acting on a sloping surface shall be assumed to act vertically on the horizontal projection of that surface.

### 1607.13.1 Distribution of roof loads.
Where uniform roof live loads are reduced to less than 20 psf (0.96 kN/m²) in accordance with Section 1607.13.2.1 and are applied to the design of structural members arranged so as to create continuity, the reduced roof live load shall be applied to adjacent spans or to alternate spans, whichever produces the most unfavorable load effect. See Section 1607.13.2 for reductions in minimum roof live loads and Section 7.5 of ASCE 7 for partial snow loading.

### 1607.13.2 General.
The minimum uniformly distributed live loads of roofs and marquees, Lo, in Table 1607.1 are permitted to be reduced in accordance with Section 1607.13.2.1.

#### 1607.13.2.1 Ordinary roofs, awnings and canopies.
Ordinary flat, pitched and curved roofs, and awnings and canopies other than of fabric construction supported by a skeleton structure, are permitted to be designed for a reduced uniformly distributed roof live load, Lr, as specified in the following equations or other controlling combinations of loads as specified in Section 1605, whichever produces the greater load effect.

In structures such as greenhouses, where special scaffolding is used as a work surface for workers and materials during maintenance and repair operations, a lower roof load than specified in the following equations shall not be used unless approved by the building official. Such structures shall be designed for a minimum roof live load of 12 psf (0.58 kN/m²).

Lr = Lo R1R2                                     (Equation 16-26)
where: 12 ≤ Lr ≤ 20
For SI: Lr = Lo R1R2
where: 0.58 ≤ Lr ≤ 0.96
Lo = Unreduced roof live load per square foot (m²) of horizontal projection supported by the member (see Table 1607.1).
Lr = Reduced roof live load per square foot (m²) of horizontal projection supported by the member.

The reduction factors R1 and R2 shall be determined as follows:

R1 = 1 for At ≤ 200 square feet (18.58 m²)       (Equation 16-27)
R1 = 1.2 - 0.001At for 200 square feet < At < 600 square feet                       (Equation 16-28)
For SI: 1.2 - 0.011At for 18.58 square meters < At < 55.74 square meters
R1 = 0.6 for At ≥ 600 square feet (55.74 m²)     (Equation 16-29)

where:
At = Tributary area (span length multiplied by effective width) in square feet (m²) supported by the member, and

R2 = 1 for F ≤ 4                                  (Equation 16-30)
R2 = 1.2 - 0.05 F for 4 < F < 12                 (Equation 16-31)
R2 = 0.6 for F ≥ 12                              (Equation 16-32)

where:
F = For a sloped roof, the number of inches of rise per foot (for SI: F = 0.12 × slope, with slope expressed as a percentage), or for an arch or dome, the rise-to-span ratio multiplied by 32.

### 1607.13.3 Occupiable roofs.
Areas of roofs that are occupiable, such as vegetative roofs, roof gardens or for assembly or other similar purposes, and marquees are permitted to have their uniformly distributed live loads reduced in accordance with Section 1607.11.

#### 1607.13.3.1 Vegetative and landscaped roofs.
The weight of all landscaping materials shall be considered as dead load and shall be computed on the basis of saturation of the soil as determined in accordance with Section 3.1.4 of ASCE 7. The uniform design live load in unoccupied landscaped areas on roofs shall be 20 psf (0.958 kN/m²).

# STRUCTURAL DESIGN

## 1609.5.3 Rigid tile.
Wind loads on rigid tile roof coverings shall be determined in accordance with the following equation:

Ma = qhCLbLLa[1.0 - GCp] (Equation 16-34)

For SI:
Ma = (qhCLbLLa[1.0 - GCp]) / 1,000

where:
b = Exposed width, feet (mm) of the roof tile.
CL = Lift coefficient. The lift coefficient for concrete and clay tile shall be 0.2 or shall be determined by test in accordance with Section 1504.2.1.
GCp = Roof pressure coefficient for each applicable roof zone determined from Chapter 30 of ASCE 7. Roof coefficients shall not be adjusted for internal pressure.
L = Length, feet (mm) of the roof tile.
La = Moment arm, feet (mm) from the axis of rotation to the point of uplift on the roof tile. The point of uplift shall be taken at 0.76L from the head of the tile and the middle of the exposed width. For roof tiles with nails or screws (with or without a tail clip), the axis of rotation shall be taken as the head of the tile for direct deck application or as the top edge of the batten for battened applications. For roof tiles fastened only by a nail or screw along the side of the tile, the axis of rotation shall be determined by testing. For roof tiles installed with battens and fastened only by a clip near the tail of the tile, the moment arm shall be determined about the top edge of the batten with consideration given for the point of rotation of the tiles based on straight bond or broken bond and the tile profile.
Ma = Aerodynamic uplift moment, feet-pounds (N-mm) acting to raise the tail of the tile.
qh = Wind velocity pressure, psf (kN/m²) determined from Section 26.10.2 of ASCE 7.

Concrete and clay roof tiles complying with the following limitations shall be designed to withstand the aerodynamic uplift moment as determined by this section.

1. The roof tiles shall be either loose laid on battens, mechanically fastened, mortar set or adhesive set.
2. The roof tiles shall be installed on solid sheathing that has been designed as components and cladding.
3. An underlayment shall be installed in accordance with Chapter 15.
4. The tile shall be single lapped interlocking with a minimum head lap of not less than 2 inches (51 mm).
5. The length of the tile shall be between 1.0 and 1.75 feet (305 mm and 533 mm).

6. The exposed width of the tile shall be between 0.67 and 1.25 feet (204 mm and 381 mm).
7. The maximum thickness of the tail of the tile shall not exceed 1.3 inches (33 mm).
8. Roof tiles using mortar set or adhesive set systems shall have not less than two-thirds of the tile's area free of mortar or adhesive contact.

## SECTION 1610 SOIL LATERAL LOADS

1610.1 General. Foundation walls and retaining walls shall be designed to resist lateral soil loads. Soil loads specified in Table 1610.1 shall be used as the minimum design lateral soil loads unless determined otherwise by a geotechnical investigation in accordance with Section 1803. Foundation walls and other walls in which horizontal movement is restricted at the top shall be designed for at-rest pressure. Retaining walls free to move and rotate at the top shall be permitted to be designed for active pressure. Design lateral pressure from surcharge loads shall be added to the lateral earth pressure load. Design lateral pressure shall be increased if soils at the site are expansive. Foundation walls shall be designed to support the weight of the full hydrostatic pressure of undrained backfill unless a drainage system is installed in accordance with Sections 1805.4.2 and 1805.4.3.

Exception: Foundation walls extending not more than 8 feet (2438 mm) below grade and laterally supported at the top by flexible diaphragms shall be permitted to be designed for active pressure.

## SECTION 1611 RAIN LOADS

1611.1 Design rain loads. Each portion of a roof shall be designed to sustain the load of rainwater that will accumulate on it if the primary drainage system for that portion is blocked plus the uniform load caused by water that rises above the inlet of the secondary drainage system at its design flow. The design rainfall shall be based on the 100-year hourly rainfall rate indicated in Figure 1611.1 or on other rainfall rates determined from approved local weather data.

R = 5.2(ds + dh) (Equation 16-35)

For SI: R = 0.0098(ds + dh)

where:
dh = Additional depth of water on the undeflected roof above the inlet of secondary drainage system at its design flow (in other words, the hydraulic head), in inches (mm).
ds = Depth of water on the undeflected roof up to the inlet of secondary drainage system when the primary drainage system is blocked (in other words, the static head), in inches (mm).

2018 INTERNATIONAL BUILDING CODE®

---

# STRUCTURAL DESIGN

R = Rain load on the undeflected roof, in psf (kN/m²).
    Where the phrase "undeflected roof" is used,
    deflections from loads (including dead loads) shall not
    be considered when determining the amount of rain on
    the roof.

## 1611.2 Ponding instability.
Susceptible bays of roofs shall be evaluated for ponding instability in accordance with Section 8.4 of ASCE 7.

## 1611.3 Controlled drainage.
Roofs equipped with hardware to control the rate of drainage shall be equipped with a secondary drainage system at a higher elevation that limits accumulation of water on the roof above that elevation. Such roofs shall be designed to sustain the load of rainwater that will accumulate on them to the elevation of the secondary drainage system plus the uniform load caused by water that rises above the inlet of the secondary drainage system at its design flow determined from Section 1611.1. Such roofs shall be checked for ponding instability in accordance with Section 1611.2.

# SECTION 1612
# FLOOD LOADS

## 1612.1 General.
Within flood hazard areas as established in Section 1612.3, all new construction of buildings, structures and portions of buildings and structures, including substantial improvement and restoration of substantial damage to buildings and structures, shall be designed and constructed to resist the effects of flood hazards and flood loads. For buildings that are located in more than one flood hazard area, the provisions associated with the most restrictive flood hazard area shall apply.

## 1612.2 Design and construction.
The design and construction of buildings and structures located in flood hazard areas, including coastal high hazard areas and coastal A zones, shall be in accordance with Chapter 5 of ASCE 7 and ASCE 24.

## 1612.3 Establishment of flood hazard areas.
To establish flood hazard areas, the applicable governing authority shall adopt a flood hazard map and supporting data. The flood hazard map shall include, at a minimum, areas of special flood hazard as identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in an engineering report entitled "The Flood Insurance Study for [INSERT NAME OF JURISDICTION]," dated [INSERT DATE OF ISSUANCE], as amended or revised with the accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and Flood Boundary and Floodway Map (FBFM) and related supporting data along with any revisions thereto. The adopted flood hazard map and supporting data are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of this section.

# STRUCTURAL DESIGN

1613.2.1(1) through 1613.2.1(8). Where S1 is less than or equal to 0.04 and SS is less than or equal to 0.15, the structure is permitted to be assigned Seismic Design Category A.

1613.2.2 Site class definitions. Based on the site soil properties, the site shall be classified as Site Class A, B, C, D, E or F in accordance with Chapter 20 of ASCE 7.

Where the soil properties are not known in sufficient detail to determine the site class, Site Class D, subjected to the requirements of Section 1613.2.3, shall be used unless the building official or geotechnical data determines that Site Class E or F soils are present at the site.

Where site investigations that are performed in accordance with Chapter 20 of ASCE 7 reveal rock conditions consistent with Site Class B, but site-specific velocity measurements are not made, the site coefficients Fa and Fv shall be taken at unity (1.0).

1613.2.3 Site coefficients and adjusted maximum considered earthquake spectral response acceleration parameters. The maximum considered earthquake spectral response acceleration for short periods, SMS, and at 1-second period, SM1, adjusted for site class effects shall be determined by Equations 16-36 and 16-37, respectively:

SMS = FaSs (Equation 16-36)

SM1 = FvS1 (Equation 16-37)

but SMS shall not be taken less than SM1 except when determining the seismic design category in accordance with Section 1613.2.5.

where:

Fa = Site coefficient defined in Table 1613.2.3(1).

Fv = Site coefficient defined in Table 1613.2.3(2).

SS = The mapped spectral accelerations for short periods as determined in Section 1613.2.1.

S1 = The mapped spectral accelerations for a 1-second period as determined in Section 1613.2.1.

Where Site Class D is selected as the default site class per Section 1613.2.2, the value of Fa shall be not less than

1.2. Where the simplified design procedure of ASCE 7 Section 12.14 is used, the value of Fa shall be determined in accordance with ASCE 7 Section 12.14.8.1, and the values of Fv, SMS and SM1 need not be determined.

1613.2.4 Design spectral response acceleration parameters. Five-percent damped design spectral response acceleration at short periods, SDS, and at 1-second period, SD1, shall be determined from Equations 16-38 and 16-39, respectively:

SDS = 2/3 SMS (Equation 16-38)

SD1 = 2/3 SM1 (Equation 16-39)

where:

SMS = The maximum considered earthquake spectral response accelerations for short period as determined in Section 1613.2.3.

SM1 = The maximum considered earthquake spectral response accelerations for 1-second period as determined in Section 1613.2.3.

1613.2.5 Determination of seismic design category. Structures classified as Risk Category I, II or III that are located where the mapped spectral response acceleration parameter at 1-second period, S1, is greater than or equal to 0.75 shall be assigned to Seismic Design Category E. Structures classified as Risk Category IV that are located where the mapped spectral response acceleration parameter at 1-second period, S1, is greater than or equal to 0.75 shall be assigned to Seismic Design Category F. Other structures shall be assigned to a seismic design category based on their risk category and the design spectral response acceleration parameters, SDS and SD1, determined in accordance with Section 1613.2.4 or the site-specific procedures of ASCE 7. Each building and structure shall be assigned to the more severe seismic design category in accordance with Table 1613.2.5(1) or 1613.2.5(2), irrespective of the fundamental period of vibration of the structure, T.

# STRUCTURAL DESIGN

## 1613.2.5.1 Alternative seismic design category deter-
mination. Where S1 is less than 0.75, the seismic
design category is permitted to be determined from
Table 1613.2.5(1) alone where all of the following
apply:
1. In each of the two orthogonal directions, the
   approximate fundamental period of the structure,
   Ta, in each of the two orthogonal directions deter-
   mined in accordance with Section 12.8.2.1 of
   ASCE 7, is less than 0.8 Ts determined in accor-
   dance with Section 11.8.6 of ASCE 7.
2. In each of the two orthogonal directions, the fun-
   damental period of the structure used to calculate
   the story drift is less than Ts.
3. Equation 12.8-2 of ASCE 7 is used to determine
   the seismic response coefficient, Cs.
4. The diaphragms are rigid or are permitted to be
   idealized as rigid in accordance with Section
   12.3.1 of ASCE 7 or, for diaphragms permitted
   to be idealized as flexible in accordance with
   Section 12.3.1 of ASCE 7, the distances
   between vertical elements of the seismic force-
   resisting system do not exceed 40 feet (12 192
   mm).

## 1613.2.5.2 Simplified design procedure. Where the
alternate simplified design procedure of ASCE 7 is
used, the seismic design category shall be determined
in accordance with ASCE 7.

## 1613.3 Ballasted photovoltaic panel systems. Ballasted,
roof-mounted photovoltaic panel systems need not be rigidly
attached to the roof or supporting structure. Ballasted non-
penetrating systems shall be designed and installed only on
roofs with slopes not more than one unit vertical in 12 units
horizontal. Ballasted nonpenetrating systems shall be
designed to resist sliding and uplift resulting from lateral and
vertical forces as required by Section 1605, using a coeffi-
cient of friction determined by acceptable engineering princi-
ples. In structures assigned to Seismic Design Category C, D,
E or F, ballasted nonpenetrating systems shall be designed to
accommodate seismic displacement determined by nonlinear
response-history or other approved analysis or shake-table
testing, using input motions consistent with ASCE 7 lateral
and vertical seismic forces for nonstructural components on
roofs.

# SECTION 1614
# ATMOSPHERIC ICE LOADS

## 1614.1 General. Ice-sensitive structures shall be designed for
atmospheric ice loads in accordance with Chapter 10 of
ASCE 7.

# SECTION 1615
# TSUNAMI LOADS

## 1615.1 General. The design and construction of Risk Cate-
gory III and IV buildings and structures located in the Tsu-
nami Design Zones defined in the Tsunami Design
Geodatabase shall be in accordance with Chapter 6 of ASCE
7, except as modified by this code.

# SECTION 1616
# STRUCTURAL INTEGRITY

## 1616.1 General. High-rise buildings that are assigned to Risk
Category III or IV shall comply with the requirements of Sec-
tion 1616.2 if they are frame structures, or Section 1616.3 if
they are bearing wall structures.

## 1616.2 Frame structures. Frame structures shall comply
with the requirements of this section.

### 1616.2.1 Concrete frame structures. Frame structures
constructed primarily of reinforced or prestressed con-
crete, either cast-in-place or precast, or a combination of
these, shall conform to the requirements of Section 4.10
of ACI 318. Where ACI 318 requires that nonprestressed
reinforcing or prestressing steel pass through the region
bounded by the longitudinal column reinforcement, that
reinforcing or prestressing steel shall have a minimum
nominal tensile strength equal to two-thirds of the
required one-way vertical strength of the connection of
the floor or roof system to the column in each direction
of beam or slab reinforcement passing through the col-
umn.

Exception: Where concrete slabs with continuous
reinforcement having an area not less than 0.0015
times the concrete area in each of two orthogonal
directions are present and are either monolithic with
or equivalently bonded to beams, girders or columns,
the longitudinal reinforcing or prestressing steel pass-
ing through the column reinforcement shall have a
nominal tensile strength of one-third of the required
one-way vertical strength of the connection of the
floor or roof system to the column in each direction of
beam or slab reinforcement passing through the col-
umn.

### 1616.2.2 Structural steel, open web steel joist or joist
girder, or composite steel and concrete frame struc-

# STRUCTURAL DESIGN

## 1616.2.2.1 Columns.
Each column splice shall have the minimum design strength in tension to transfer the design dead and live load tributary to the column between the splice and the splice or base immediately below.

## 1616.2.2.2 Beams.
End connections of all beams and girders shall have a minimum nominal axial tensile strength equal to the required vertical shear strength for allowable stress design (ASD) or two-thirds of the required shear strength for load and resistance factor design (LRFD) but not less than 10 kips (45 kN). For the purpose of this section, the shear force and the axial tensile force need not be considered to act simultaneously.

**Exception:** Where beams, girders, open web joist and joist girders support a concrete slab or concrete slab on metal deck that is attached to the beam or girder with not less than 3/8-inch-diameter (9.5 mm) headed shear studs, at a spacing of not more than 12 inches (305 mm) on center, averaged over the length of the member, or other attachment having equivalent shear strength, and the slab contains continuous distributed reinforcement in each of two orthogonal directions with an area not less than 0.0015 times the concrete area, the nominal axial tension strength of the end connection shall be permitted to be taken as half the required vertical shear strength for ASD or one-third of the required shear strength for LRFD, but not less than 10 kips (45 kN).

## 1616.3 Bearing wall structures.
Bearing wall structures shall have vertical ties in all load-bearing walls and longitudinal ties, transverse ties and perimeter ties at each floor level in accordance with this section and as shown in Figure 1616.3.

Ties shall have a minimum nominal tensile strength, T<sub>T</sub>, given by Equation 16-40. For ASD the minimum nominal tensile strength shall be permitted to be taken as 1.5 times the allowable tensile stress times the area of the tie.

T<sub>T</sub> = w·L<sub>S</sub>·≤ α<sub>T</sub>S (Equation 16-40)

where:

L = The span of the horizontal element in the direction of the tie, between bearing walls, feet (m).

w = The weight per unit area of the floor or roof in the span being tied to or across the wall, psf (N/m<sup>2</sup>).

S = The spacing between ties, feet (m).

α<sub>T</sub> = A coefficient with a value of 1,500 pounds per foot (2.25 kN/m) for masonry bearing wall structures and a value of 375 pounds per foot (0.6 kN/m) for structures with bearing walls of cold-formed steel light-frame construction.

[Map of western United States showing contour lines and numerical values]

## DISCUSSION

Maps prepared by United States Geological Survey (USGS) in collaboration with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)-funded Building Seismic Safety Council (BSSC) and the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE). The basis is explained in commentaries prepared by BSSC and ASCE and in the references. Ground motion values contoured on these maps incorporate:
- a target risk of structural collapse equal to 1% in 50 years based upon a generic structural fragility
- a factor of 1.1 to adjust from a geometric mean to the maximum response regardless of direction
- deterministic upper limits imposed near large, active faults, which are taken as 1.8 times the estimated median response to the characteristic earthquake for the governing fault (1.8 is used to represent the 84th percentile response), but not less than 150% g.

As such, the values are different from those on the uniform-hazard 2014 USGS National Seismic Hazard Maps posted at: http://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/products/.

Larger, more detailed versions of these maps are not provided because it is recommended that the corresponding USGS web tool (http://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/designmaps/ or http://content.seinstitute.org) be used to determine the mapped value for a specified location.

![Seismic hazard maps for Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands showing 0.2 Second and 1.0 Second Spectral Response Acceleration]

## Explanation

Contours of spectral response acceleration 
expressed as a percent of gravity:
- 10 —
- 50 —

Point values of spectral response acceleration 
expressed as a percent of gravity:
- 202 Local minimum
- 208 Local maximum
- 239 Saddle point

## DISCUSSION

Maps prepared by United States Geological Survey (USGS) in 
collaboration with the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
(FEMA) and explained in commentary prepared by BSSC and its 
Provisions Update Committee. These maps incorporate:
- a target risk of structural collapse equal to 1% in 50 years 
based upon a generic structural fragility
- a factor of 1.1 to adjust from a geometric mean to the maximum response 
regardless of direction
- deterministic upper limits imposed near large, active faults, 
consistent with the characteristic earthquake for the fault
- the local site condition at each location is considered to be 
the boundary between site classes B and C

As such, the values are different from those on the uniform-
hazard 2010 USGS National Seismic Hazard Maps for Guam 
and the Northern Mariana Islands Web site: 
http://earthquake.usgs.gov/hazards/

Larger, more detailed versions of these maps are provided 
on the USGS web site. Users should consult the USGS web 
site to determine the mapped value for a specified location.

The image shows two seismic hazard maps for American Samoa, providing risk-targeted maximum considered earthquake (MCER) ground motion response accelerations. These maps are part of the structural design section of what appears to be the 2018 International Building Code.

The top map shows the 0.2 Second Spectral Response Acceleration (5% of Critical Damping), while the bottom map shows the 1.0 Second Spectral Response Acceleration (5% of Critical Damping).

Both maps display contour lines representing different levels of ground motion acceleration across the islands of American Samoa, including Swains Island, Tutuila, Ofu, Olosega, Ta'u, and Rose Atoll.

The maps have a scale bar indicating distances up to 100 miles and 100 kilometers.

An explanation box on the left side of the image describes how to interpret the contour intervals, which are given in units of %g (percent of gravitational acceleration).

A discussion section at the bottom left provides information about the map's creation, mentioning that it was prepared by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) in collaboration with FEMA and the Building Seismic Safety Council (BSSC).

The figure is labeled as Figure 1613.2.1(8) and is titled "RISK-TARGETED MAXIMUM CONSIDERED EARTHQUAKE (MCER) GROUND MOTION RESPONSE ACCELERATIONS FOR AMERICAN SAMOA OF 0.2- AND 1-SECOND SPECTRAL RESPONSE ACCELERATION (5% OF CRITICAL DAMPING)".

At the bottom, there's a reference section listing several sources used in creating these maps.

This figure is part of page 413 of the 2018 International Building Code, as indicated at the bottom of the image.

# CHAPTER 17

# SPECIAL INSPECTIONS AND TESTS

User notes:
    About this chapter: Chapter 17 provides a variety of procedures and criteria for testing materials and assemblies, and labeling materials and
    assemblies. Its key purposes are to establish where additional inspections/observations and testing must be provided, and the submittals and
    verifications that must be provided to the building official. This chapter expands on the inspections of Chapter 1 by requiring special inspection
    by a qualified individual where indicated and, in some cases, structural observation by a registered design professional. Quality assurance
    measures that verify proper assembly of structural components and the suitability of the installed materials are intended to provide a building
    that, once constructed, complies with the minimum structural and fire-resistance code requirements as well as the approved design. To deter-
    mine this compliance often requires frequent inspections and testing at specific stages of construction.

Code development reminder: Code change proposals to sections preceded by the designation [BF] will be considered by the IBC—Fire
Safety Code Development Committee during the 2018 (Group A) Code Development Cycle. Sections preceded by the designation [F] will be
considered by the International Fire Code Development Committee during the 2018 (Group A) Code Development Cycle. All other code
change proposals will be considered by the IBC—Structural Code Development Committee during the Group B cycle. See explanation on
page iv.

and one-half times the superimposed design load. In the
case of structural components and assemblies for which
deflection limitations are not specified in Section
1709.3.2, the test specimen shall be subjected to an
increasing superimposed load until structural failure
occurs or the load is equal to two and one-half times the
desired superimposed design load. The allowable superim-
posed design load shall be taken as the lesser of:

1. The load at the deflection limitation given in Section
   1709.3.2.

2. The failure load divided by 2.5.

3. The maximum load applied divided by 2.5.

EXCAVATION, GRADING AND FILL

1804.1 Excavation near foundations. Excavation for any
purpose shall not reduce vertical or lateral support for any
foundation or adjacent foundation without first underpinning
or protecting the foundation against detrimental lateral or ver-
tical movement, or both.

1804.2 Underpinning. Where underpinning is chosen to pro-
vide the protection or support of adjacent structures, the
underpinning system shall be designed and installed in accor-
dance with provisions of this chapter and Chapter 33.
    1804.2.1 Underpinning sequencing. Underpinning shall
    be installed in a sequential manner that protects the neigh-
    boring structure and the working construction site. The
    sequence of installation shall be identified in the approved
    construction documents.

1804.3 Placement of backfill. The excavation outside the
foundation shall be backfilled with soil that is free of organic
material, construction debris, cobbles and boulders or with a
controlled low-strength material (CLSM). The backfill shall
be placed in lifts and compacted in a manner that does not
damage the foundation or the waterproofing or dampproofing
material.
    Exception: CLSM need not be compacted.

1804.4 Site grading. The ground immediately adjacent to the
foundation shall be sloped away from the building at a slope
of not less than one unit vertical in 20 units horizontal (5-per-
cent slope) for a minimum distance of 10 feet (3048 mm)
measured perpendicular to the face of the wall. If physical
obstructions or lot lines prohibit 10 feet (3048 mm) of hori-
zontal distance, a 5-percent slope shall be provided to an
approved alternative method of diverting water away from
the foundation. Swales used for this purpose shall be sloped
not less than 2 percent where located within 10 feet (3048
mm) of the building foundation. Impervious surfaces within
10 feet (3048 mm) of the building foundation shall be sloped
not less than 2 percent away from the building.
    Exceptions:
        1. Where climatic or soil conditions warrant, the slope
           of the ground away from the building foundation
           shall be permitted to be reduced to not less than one
           unit vertical in 48 units horizontal (2-percent slope).
        2. Impervious surfaces shall be permitted to be sloped
           less than 2 percent where the surface is a door land-
           ing or ramp that is required to comply with Section
           1010.1.5, 1012.3 or 1012.6.1.

a. For design lateral soil loads, see Section 1610.
b. Provisions for this table are based on design and construction requirements specified in Section 1807.1.6.3.
c. Solid grouted hollow units or solid masonry units.
d. A design in compliance with Chapter 21 or reinforcement in accordance with Table 1807.1.6.3(2) is required.
e. For height of unbalanced backfill, see Section 1807.1.2.
f. Where unbalanced backfill height exceeds 8 feet and design lateral soil loads from Table 1610.1 are used, the requirements for 30 and 45 psf per foot of depth are not applicable (see Section 1610).

than 6 feet (1829 mm) of backfill height shall incorporate the additional seismic lateral earth pressure in accordance with the geotechnical investigation where required in Section 1803.2.

1807.2.3 Safety factor. Retaining walls shall be designed to resist the lateral action of soil to produce sliding and overturning with a minimum safety factor of 1.5 in each case. The load combinations of Section 1605 shall not apply to this requirement. Instead, design shall be based on 0.7 times nominal earthquake loads, 1.0 times other nominal loads, and investigation with one or more of the variable loads set to zero. The safety factor against lateral sliding shall be taken as the available soil resistance at the base of the retaining wall foundation divided by the net lateral force applied to the retaining wall.

Exception: Where earthquake loads are included, the minimum safety factor for retaining wall sliding and overturning shall be 1.1.

1807.3 Embedded posts and poles. Designs to resist both axial and lateral loads employing posts or poles as columns embedded in earth or in concrete footings in earth shall be in accordance with Sections 1807.3.1 through 1807.3.3.

1807.3.1 Limitations. The design procedures outlined in this section are subject to the following limitations:

1. The frictional resistance for structural walls and slabs on silts and clays shall be limited to one-half of the normal force imposed on the soil by the weight of the footing or slab.

2. Posts embedded in earth shall not be used to provide lateral support for structural or nonstructural materi-

als such as plaster, masonry or concrete unless bracing is provided that develops the limited deflection required.

Wood poles shall be treated in accordance with AWPA U1 for sawn timber posts (Commodity Specification A, Use Category 4B) and for round timber posts (Commodity Specification B, Use Category 4B).

1807.3.2 Design criteria. The depth to resist lateral loads shall be determined using the design criteria established in Sections 1807.3.2.1 through 1807.3.2.3, or by other methods approved by the building official.

1807.3.2.1 Nonconstrained. The following formula shall be used in determining the depth of embedment required to resist lateral loads where lateral constraint is not provided at the ground surface, such as by a rigid floor or rigid ground surface pavement, and where lateral constraint is not provided above the ground surface, such as by a structural diaphragm.

d = 0.5A{1 + [1 + (4.36h/A)]1/2}    (Equation 18-1)

where:
A = 2.34P/(S1b).
b = Diameter of round post or footing or diagonal dimension of square post or footing, feet (m).
d = Depth of embedment in earth in feet (m) but not over 12 feet (3658 mm) for purpose of computing lateral pressure.
h = Distance in feet (m) from ground surface to point of application of "P."
P = Applied lateral force in pounds (kN).

or raft foundations on expansive soils shall be determined
in accordance with WRI/CRSI Design of Slab-on-Ground
Foundations or PTI DC 10.5. Using the moments, shears
and deflections determined above, nonprestressed slabs-
on-ground, mat or raft foundations on expansive soils shall
be designed in accordance with WRI/CRSI Design of Slab-
on-Ground Foundations and post-tensioned slab-on-
ground, mat or raft foundations on expansive soils shall be
designed in accordance with PTI DC 10.5. It shall be per-
mitted to analyze and design such slabs by other methods
that account for soil-structure interaction, the deformed
shape of the soil support, the plate or stiffened plate action
of the slab as well as both center lift and edge lift condi-
tions. Such alternative methods shall be rational and the
basis for all aspects and parameters of the method shall be
available for peer review.

**1808.6.3 Removal of expansive soil.** Where expansive
soil is removed in lieu of designing foundations in accor-
dance with Section 1808.6.1 or 1808.6.2, the soil shall be
removed to a depth sufficient to ensure a constant moisture
content in the remaining soil. Fill material shall not con-
tain expansive soils and shall comply with Section 1804.5
or 1804.6.

**Exception:** Expansive soil need not be removed to the
depth of constant moisture, provided that the confining
pressure in the expansive soil created by the fill and
supported structure exceeds the swell pressure.

**1808.6.4 Stabilization.** Where the active zone of expan-
sive soils is stabilized in lieu of designing foundations in
accordance with Section 1808.6.1 or 1808.6.2, the soil
shall be stabilized by chemical, dewatering, presaturation
or equivalent techniques.

ment of buildings and structures on or adjacent to slopes
steeper than one unit vertical in three units horizontal (33.3-
percent slope) shall comply with Sections 1808.7.1 through
1808.7.5.

**1808.7.1 Building clearance from ascending slopes.** In
general, buildings below slopes shall be set a sufficient
distance from the slope to provide protection from slope
drainage, erosion and shallow failures. Except as provided
in Section 1808.7.5 and Figure 1808.7.1, the following cri-
teria will be assumed to provide this protection. Where the

existing slope is steeper than one unit vertical in one unit
horizontal (100-percent slope), the toe of the slope shall be
assumed to be at the intersection of a horizontal plane
drawn from the top of the foundation and a plane drawn
tangent to the slope at an angle of 45 degrees (0.79 rad) to
the horizontal. Where a retaining wall is constructed at the
toe of the slope, the height of the slope shall be measured
from the top of the wall to the top of the slope.

**1808.7.2 Foundation setback from descending slope
surface.** Foundations on or adjacent to slope surfaces shall
be founded in firm material with an embedment and set
back from the slope surface sufficient to provide vertical
and lateral support for the foundation without detrimental
settlement. Except as provided for in Section 1808.7.5 and
Figure 1808.7.1, the following setback is deemed adequate
to meet the criteria. Where the slope is steeper than 1 unit
vertical in 1 unit horizontal (100-percent slope), the
required setback shall be measured from an imaginary
plane 45 degrees (0.79 rad) to the horizontal, projected
upward from the toe of the slope.

**1808.7.3 Pools.** The setback between pools regulated by
this code and slopes shall be equal to one-half the building
footing setback distance required by this section. That por-
tion of the pool wall within a horizontal distance of 7 feet
(2134 mm) from the top of the slope shall be capable of
supporting the water in the pool without soil support.

**1808.7.4 Foundation elevation.** On graded sites, the top
of any exterior foundation shall extend above the elevation
of the street gutter at point of discharge or the inlet of an
approved drainage device not less than 12 inches (305
mm) plus 2 percent. Alternate elevations are permitted
subject to the approval of the building official, provided
that it can be demonstrated that required drainage to the
point of discharge and away from the structure is provided
at all locations on the site.

**1808.7.5 Alternate setback and clearance.** Alternate set-
backs and clearances are permitted, subject to the approval
of the building official. The building official shall be per-
mitted to require a geotechnical investigation as set forth
in Section 1803.5.10.

tlement shall cause neither harmful distortion of, nor insta-
bility in, the structure, nor cause any element to be loaded
beyond its capacity.

1810.2.4 Lateral loads. The moments, shears and lateral
deflections used for design of deep foundation elements
shall be established considering the nonlinear interaction
of the shaft and soil, as determined by a registered design
professional. Where the ratio of the depth of embedment
of the element to its least horizontal dimension is less than

effects on lateral behavior where the center-to-center spac-
ing of deep foundation elements in the direction of lateral
force is less than eight times the least horizontal dimen-
sion of an element. The analysis shall include group
effects on axial behavior where the center-to-center spac-
ing of deep foundation elements is less than three times

1810.3.3.1.2 Load tests. Where design compressive loads are greater than those determined using the allowable stresses specified in Section 1810.3.2.6, where the design load for any deep foundation element is in doubt, or where cast-in-place deep foundation elements have an enlarged base formed either by compacting concrete or by driving a precast base, control test elements shall be tested in accordance with ASTM D1143 or ASTM D4945. One element or more shall be load tested in each area of uniform subsoil conditions. Where required by the building official, additional elements shall be load tested where necessary to establish the safe design capacity. The resulting allowable loads shall not be more than one-half of the ultimate axial load capacity of the test element as assessed by one of the published methods listed in Section 1810.3.3.1.3 with consideration for the test type, duration and subsoil. The ultimate axial load capacity shall be determined by a registered design professional with consideration given to tolerable total and differential settlements at design load in accordance with Section 1810.2.3. In subsequent installation of the balance of deep foundation elements, all elements shall be deemed to have a supporting capacity equal to that of the control element where such elements are of the same type, size and relative length as the test element; are installed using the same or comparable methods and equipment as the test element; are installed in similar subsoil conditions as the test element; and, for driven elements, where the rate of penetration (for example, net displacement per blow) of such elements is equal to or less than that of the test element driven with the same hammer through a comparable driving distance.

1810.3.3.1.3 Load test evaluation methods. It shall be permitted to evaluate load tests of deep foundation elements using any of the following methods:
1. Davisson Offset Limit.
2. Brinch-Hansen 90-percent Criterion.
3. Butler-Hoy Criterion.
4. Other methods approved by the building official.

1810.3.3.1.4 Allowable shaft resistance. The assumed shaft resistance developed by any uncased cast-in-place deep foundation element shall not exceed one-sixth of the bearing value of the soil material at minimum depth as set forth in Table 1806.2, up to 500 psf (24 kPa), unless a greater value is allowed by the building official on the basis of a geotechnical investigation as specified in Section 1803 or a greater value is substantiated by a load test in accordance with Section 1810.3.3.1.2. Shaft resistance and end-bearing resistance shall not be assumed to act simultaneously unless determined by a geotechnical investigation in accordance with Section 1803.

1810.3.3.1.5 Uplift capacity of a single deep foundation element. Where required by the design, the uplift capacity of a single deep foundation element shall be determined by an approved method of analysis based on a minimum factor of safety of three or by load tests conducted in accordance with ASTM D3689. The maximum allowable uplift load shall not exceed the ultimate load capacity as determined in Section 1810.3.3.1.2, using the results of load tests conducted in accordance with ASTM D3689, divided by a factor of safety of two.

Exception: Where uplift is due to wind or seismic loading, the minimum factor of safety shall be two where capacity is determined by an analysis and one and one-half where capacity is determined by load tests.

1810.3.3.1.6 Allowable uplift load of grouped deep foundation elements. For grouped deep foundation elements subjected to uplift, the allowable uplift load for the group shall be calculated by a generally accepted method of analysis. Where the deep foundation elements in the group are placed at a center-to-center spacing less than three times the least horizontal dimension of the largest single element, the allowable uplift load for the group is permitted to be calculated as the lesser of:

1. The proposed individual allowable uplift load times the number of elements in the group.
2. Two-thirds of the effective weight of the group and the soil contained within a block defined by the perimeter of the group and the length of the element, plus two-thirds of the ultimate shear resistance along the soil block.

1810.3.3.1.7 Load-bearing capacity. Deep foundation elements shall develop ultimate load capacities of not less than twice the design working loads in the designated load-bearing layers. Analysis shall show that soil layers underlying the designated load-bearing layers do not cause the load-bearing capacity safety factor to be less than two.

1810.3.3.1.8 Bent deep foundation elements. The load-bearing capacity of deep foundation elements discovered to have a sharp or sweeping bend shall be determined by an approved method of analysis or by load testing a representative element.

1810.3.3.1.9 Helical piles. The allowable axial design load, P<sub>a</sub>, of helical piles shall be determined as follows:

P<sub>a</sub> = 0.5 P<sub>u</sub>                                  (Equation 18-4)

where P<sub>u</sub> is the least value of:
1. Sum of the areas of the helical bearing plates times the ultimate bearing capacity of the soil or rock comprising the bearing stratum.
2. Ultimate capacity determined from well-documented correlations with installation torque.
3. Ultimate capacity determined from load tests.

more than one-half of the load that produces a gross lat-
eral movement of 1 inch (25 mm) at the lower of the
top of foundation element and the ground surface,
unless it can be shown that the predicted lateral move-
ment shall cause neither harmful distortion of, nor

loaded beyond its capacity.

**1810.3.4 Subsiding soils.** Where deep foundation ele-

Design Category C, D, E or F, individual deep foundations
shall be interconnected by ties. Unless it can be demon-
strated that equivalent restraint is provided by reinforced
concrete beams within slabs on grade or reinforced con-
crete slabs on grade or confinement by competent rock,

   About this chapter: Chapter 19 provides minimum accepted practices for the design and construction of buildings and structural compo-
   nents using concrete—both plain and reinforced. Chapter 19 relies primarily on the reference to American Concrete Institute (ACI) 318, Build-
   ing Code Requirements for Structural Concrete. Structural concrete must be designed and constructed to comply with this code and all listed
   standards. There are also specific provisions addressing concrete slabs and shotcrete.
   Code development reminder: Code change proposals to this chapter will be considered by the IBC—Structural Code Development Commit-
   tee during the 2019 (Group B) Code Development Cycle. See explanation on page iv.

# CHAPTER 20

# ALUMINUM

User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 20 contains standards for the use of aluminum in building construction. Only the structural applications of aluminum are addressed so it would not apply to the use of aluminum in specialty products such as storefront or window framing or architectural hardware. The use of aluminum in heating, ventilating or air-conditioning systems is addressed in the International Mechanical Code (IMC). This chapter references national standards from the Aluminum Association for use of aluminum in building construction, AA ASM 35, Aluminum Sheet Metal Work in Building Construction, and AA ADM 1, Aluminum Design Manual.

Code development reminder: Code change proposals to this chapter will be considered by the IBC—Structural Code Development Committee during the 2019 (Group B) Code Development Cycle. See explanation on page iv.

User notes:
    About this chapter: Chapter 23 provides minimum requirements for the design of buildings and structures that use wood and wood-based
    products. The chapter is organized around three design methodologies: allowable stress design (ASD), load and resistance factor design
    (LRFD) and conventional light-frame construction. In addition it allows the use of the American Wood Council Wood Frame Construction Man-
    ual for a limited range of structures. Included in the chapter are references to design and manufacturing standards for various wood and
    wood-based products; general construction requirements; design criteria for lateral force-resisting systems and specific requirements for the
    application of the three design methods.

## 2303.2 Fire-retardant-treated wood. 
Fire-retardant-treated wood is any wood product that, when impregnated with chemicals by a pressure process or other means during manufacture, shall have, when tested in accordance with ASTM E84 or UL 723, a listed flame spread index of 25 or less and show no evidence of significant progressive combustion when the test is continued for an additional 20-minute period. Additionally, the flame front shall not progress more than 10 1/2 feet (3200 mm) beyond the centerline of the burners at any time during the test.

### 2303.2.1 Pressure process. 
For wood products impregnated with chemicals by a pressure process, the process shall be performed in closed vessels under pressures not less than 50 pounds per square inch gauge (psig) (345 kPa).

### 2303.2.2 Other means during manufacture. 
For wood products impregnated with chemicals by other means during manufacture, the treatment shall be an integral part of the manufacturing process of the wood product. The treatment shall provide permanent protection to all surfaces of the wood product. The use of paints, coating, stains or other surface treatments is not an approved method of protection as required in this section.

### 2303.2.3 Testing. 
For wood products produced by other means during manufacture, other than a pressure process, all sides of the wood product shall be tested in accordance with and produce the results required in Section 2303.2. Wood structural panels shall be permitted to test only the front and back faces.

### 2303.2.4 Labeling. 
In addition to the labels required in Section 2303.1.1 for sawn lumber and Section 2303.1.5 for wood structural panels, each piece of fire-retardant-treated lumber and wood structural panels shall be labeled. The label shall contain the following items:

For SI: 1 inch = 25.4 mm, 1 pound per square foot = 0.0479 kPa.
a. Spans are given in feet and inches.
b. Spans are based on minimum design properties for No. 2 grade lumber of Douglas fir-larch, hem-fir, Southern pine and spruce-pine fir.
c. Building width is measured perpendicular to the ridge. For widths between those shown, spans are permitted to be interpolated.
d. NJ = Number of jack studs required to support each end. Where the number of required jack studs equals one, the header is permitted to be supported by an
   approved framing anchor attached to the full-height wall stud and to the header.
e. Use 30 psf ground snow load for cases in which ground snow load is less than 30 psf and the roof live load is equal to or less than 20 psf.
f. Spans are calculated assuming the top of the header or girder is laterally braced by perpendicular framing. Where the top of the header or girder is not laterally
   braced (for example, cripple studs bearing on the header), tabulated spans for headers consisting of 2 × 8, 2 × 10, or 2 × 12 sizes shall be multiplied by 0.70 or
   the header or girder shall be designed.

A braced wall panel shall be located at each end of the braced wall line and at the corners of intersecting braced wall lines or shall begin within the maximum distance from the end of the braced wall line in accordance with Table 2308.6.1. Braced wall panels in a braced wall line shall not be offset from each other by more than 4 feet (1219 mm). Braced wall panels shall be clearly indicated on the plans.

2308.6.3 Braced wall panel methods. Construction of braced wall panels shall be by one or a combination of the methods in Table 2308.6.3(1). Braced wall panel length shall be in accordance with Section 2308.6.4 or 2308.6.5.

2308.6.4 Braced wall panel construction. For Methods DWB, WSP, SFB, PBS, PCP and HPS, each panel must be not less than 48 inches (1219 mm) in length, covering three stud spaces where studs are spaced 16 inches (406 mm) on center and covering two stud spaces where studs are spaced 24 inches (610 mm) on center. Braced wall panels less than 48 inches (1219 mm) in length shall not contribute toward the amount of required bracing. Braced wall panels that are longer than the required length shall be credited for their actual length. For Method GB, each panel must be not less than 96 inches (2438 mm) in length where applied to one side of the studs or 48 inches (1219 mm) in length where applied to both sides.

Vertical joints of panel sheathing shall occur over studs and adjacent panel joints shall be nailed to common framing members. Horizontal joints shall occur over blocking or other framing equal in size to the studding except where waived by the installation requirements for the specific sheathing materials. Sole plates shall be nailed to the floor framing in accordance with Section 2308.6.7 and top plates shall be connected to the framing above in accordance with Section 2308.6.7.2. Where joists are perpendicular to braced wall lines above, blocking shall be provided under and in line with the braced wall panels.

2308.6.5 Alternative bracing. An alternate braced wall (ABW) or a portal frame with hold-downs (PFH) de-

scribed in this section is permitted to substitute for a 48-inch (1219 mm) braced wall panel of Method DWB, WSP, SFB, PBS, PCP or HPS. For Method GB, each 96-inch (2438 mm) section (applied to one face) or 48-inch (1219 mm) section (applied to both faces) or portion thereof required by Table 2308.6.1 is permitted to be replaced by one panel constructed in accordance with Method ABW or PFH.

2308.6.5.1. Alternate braced wall (ABW). An ABW shall be constructed in accordance with this section and Figure 2308.6.5.1. In one-story buildings, each panel shall have a length of not less than 2 feet 8 inches (813 mm) and a height of not more than 10 feet (3048 mm). Each panel shall be sheathed on one face with 3/8-inch (3.2 mm) minimum-thickness wood structural panel sheathing nailed with 8d common or galvanized box nails in accordance with Table 2304.10.1 and blocked at wood structural panel edges. Two anchor bolts installed in accordance with Section 2308.3.1 shall be provided in each panel. Anchor bolts shall be placed at each panel outside quarter points. Each panel end stud shall have a hold-down device fastened to the foundation, capable of providing an approved uplift capacity of not less than 1,800 pounds (8006 N). The hold-down device shall be installed in accordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. The ABW shall be supported directly on a foundation or on floor framing supported directly on a foundation that is continuous across the entire length of the braced wall line. This foundation shall be reinforced with not less than one No. 4 bar top and bottom. Where the continuous foundation is required to have a depth greater than 12 inches (305 mm), a minimum 12-inch by 12-inch (305 mm by 305 mm) continuous footing or turned-down slab edge is permitted at door openings in the braced wall line. This continuous footing or turned-down slab edge shall be reinforced with not less than one No. 4 bar top and bottom. This reinforcement shall be lapped 15 inches (381 mm) with the reinforcement required in the continuous foundation located directly under the braced wall line.

### 2308.6.8.1 Foundation requirements.
Braced wall lines shall be supported by continuous foundations.

**Exception:** For structures with a maximum plan dimension not more than 50 feet (15 240 mm), continuous foundations are required at exterior walls only.

For structures in Seismic Design Categories D and E, exterior braced wall panels shall be in the same plane vertically with the foundation or the portion of the structure containing the offset shall be designed in accordance with accepted engineering practice and Section 2308.1.1.

**Exceptions:**

1. Exterior braced wall panels shall be permitted to be located not more than 4 feet (1219 mm) from the foundation below where supported by a floor constructed in accordance with all of the following:
   1.1. Cantilevers or setbacks shall not exceed four times the nominal depth of the floor joists.
   1.2. Floor joists shall be 2 inches by 10 inches (51 mm by 254 mm) or larger and spaced not more than 16 inches (406 mm) on center.
   1.3. The ratio of the back span to the cantilever shall be not less than 2 to 1.
   1.4. Floor joists at ends of braced wall panels shall be doubled.
   1.5. A continuous rim joist shall be connected to the ends of cantilevered joists. The rim joist is permitted to be spliced using a metal tie not less than 0.058 inch (1.47 mm) (16 galvanized gage) and 1 1/2 inches (38 mm) in width fastened with six 16d common nails on each side. The metal tie shall have a yield stress not less than 33,000 psi (227 MPa).
   1.6. Joists at setbacks or the end of cantilevered joists shall not carry gravity loads from more than a single story having uniform wall and roof loads nor carry the reactions from headers having a span of 8 feet (2438 mm) or more.

2. The end of a required braced wall panel shall be allowed to extend not more than 1 foot (305 mm) over an opening in the wall below. This requirement is applicable to braced wall panels offset in plane and braced wall panels offset out of plane as permitted by Exception 1. Braced wall panels are permitted to extend over an opening not more than 8 feet (2438 mm) in width where the header is a 4-inch by 12-inch (102 mm by 305 mm) or larger member.

        dance with Section 2306.3 shall be not
        less than 350 plf (5108 N/m).
   3.2. Braced wall panels in the second story
        shall be located in accordance with

Section 2308.6.1 and not more than 25
feet (7620 mm) on center, and the total
length of braced wall panels shall be
not less than 25 percent of the braced
wall line length. Braced wall panels in
the first story shall be located in accor-
dance with Section 2308.6.1 and not
more than 25 feet (7620 mm) on cen-
ter, and the total length of braced wall
panels shall be not less than 45 percent

b. The uplift connection requirements are based on the framing being spaced 24 inches on center. Multiply by 0.67 for framing spaced 16 inches on center and
   multiply by 0.5 for framing spaced 12 inches on center.
c. The uplift connection requirements include an allowance for 10 pounds of dead load.
d. The uplift connection requirements do not account for the effects of overhangs. The magnitude of the loads shall be increased by adding the overhang loads
   found in the table. The overhang loads are based on framing spaced 24 inches on center. The overhang loads given shall be multiplied by the overhang
   projection and added to the roof uplift value in the table.
e. The uplift connection requirements are based on wind loading on end zones as defined in Figure 28.5-1 of ASCE 7. Connection loads for connections located
   a distance of 20 percent of the least horizontal dimension of the building from the corner of the building are permitted to be reduced by multiplying the table
   connection value by 0.7 and multiplying the overhang load by 0.8.
f. For wall-to-wall and wall-to-foundation connections, the capacity of the uplift connector is permitted to be reduced by 100 pounds for each full wall above.
   (For example, if a 500-pound rated connector is used on the roof framing, a 400-pound rated connector is permitted at the next floor level down).
g. Interpolation is permitted for intermediate values of Vasd and roof spans.
h. The rated capacity of approved tie-down devices is permitted to include up to a 60-percent increase for wind effects where allowed by material specifications.
i. Vasd shall be determined in accordance with Section 1609.3.1.

Check sources for availability of lumber in lengths greater than 20 feet.
For SI: 1 inch = 25.4 mm, 1 foot = 304.8 mm, 1 pound per square foot = 0.0479 kPa.
a. The tabulated rafter spans assume that ceiling joists are located at the bottom of the attic space or that some other method of resisting the outward push of the
rafters on the bearing walls, such as rafter ties, is provided at that location. Where ceiling joists or rafter ties are located higher in the attic space, the rafter
spans shall be multiplied by the following factors:

| H<sub>C</sub>/H<sub>R</sub> | Rafter Span Adjustment Factor |
|---|---|
| 1/3 | 0.67 |
| 1/4 | 0.76 |
| 1/5 | 0.83 |
| 1/6 | 0.90 |
| 1/7.5 or less | 1.00 |

where:
H<sub>C</sub> = Height of ceiling joists or rafter ties measured vertically above the top of the rafter support walls.
H<sub>R</sub> = Height of roof ridge measured vertically above the top of the rafter support walls.
b. Span exceeds 26 feet in length.

a. 40d box (5" × 0.162") or 16d sinker (3¼" × 0.148") nails are permitted to be substituted for 16d common (3½" × 0.16") nails.
b. Nailing requirements are permitted to be reduced 25 percent if nails are clinched.
c. Rafter tie heel joint connections are not required where the ridge is supported by a load-bearing wall, header or ridge beam.
d. Where intermediate support of the rafter is provided by vertical struts or purlins to a load-bearing wall, the tabulated heel joint connection requirements are permitted to be reduced proportionally to the reduction in span.
e. Equivalent nailing patterns are required for ceiling joist to ceiling joist lap splices.
f. Connected members shall be of sufficient size to prevent splitting due to nailing.
g. For snow loads less than 30 pounds per square foot, the required number of nails is permitted to be reduced by multiplying by the ratio of actual snow load plus 10 divided by 40, but not less than the number required for no snow load.

# CHAPTER 24

# GLASS AND GLAZING

User notes:
    About this chapter: Chapter 24 establishes regulations for glass and glazing used in buildings and structures. Engineering and design
    requirements are included in the chapter for glazing that is subjected to wind and snow loads. Another concern of this chapter is glass and
    glazing used in areas where it is likely to be impacted by the occupants. Section 2406 identifies hazardous locations where glazing must
    either be safety glazing or protected to prevent impacts by occupants. Safety glazing must meet stringent standards and be appropriately
    marked or identified. Additional requirements are provided for glass and glazing in guards, handrails, elevator hoistways and elevator cars, as
    well as in athletic facilities.
    Code development reminder: Code change proposals to this chapter will be considered by the IBC—Structural Code Development Commit-
    tee during the 2019 (Group B) Code Development Cycle. See explanation on page iv.

## SECTION 2401
## GENERAL
**2401.1 Scope.** The provisions of this chapter shall govern the
materials, design, construction and quality of glass, light-
transmitting ceramic and light-transmitting plastic panels for
exterior and interior use in both vertical and sloped applica-
tions in buildings and structures.

## SECTION 2402
## GLAZING REPLACEMENT
**2402.1 General.** The installation of replacement glass shall
be as required for new installations.

## SECTION 2403
## GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR GLASS
**2403.1 Identification.** Each pane shall bear the manufac-
turer's mark designating the type and thickness of the glass or
glazing material. The identification shall not be omitted
unless approved and an affidavit is furnished by the glazing
contractor certifying that each light is glazed in accordance
with approved construction documents that comply with the
provisions of this chapter. Safety glazing shall be identified in
accordance with Section 2406.3.

Each pane of tempered glass, except tempered spandrel
glass, shall be permanently identified by the manufacturer.
The identification mark shall be acid etched, sand blasted,
ceramic fired, laser etched, embossed or of a type that, once
applied, cannot be removed without being destroyed.

Tempered spandrel glass shall be provided with a remov-
able paper marking by the manufacturer.

**2403.2 Glass supports.** Where one or more sides of any pane
of glass are not firmly supported, or are subjected to unusual
load conditions, detailed construction documents, detailed
shop drawings and analysis or test data ensuring safe perfor-
mance for the specific installation shall be prepared by a reg-
istered design professional.

**2403.3 Framing.** To be considered firmly supported, the
framing members for each individual pane of glass shall be
designed so the deflection of the edge of the glass perpendic-
ular to the glass pane shall not exceed 1/175 of the glass edge
length or 3/4 inch (19.1 mm), whichever is less, when sub-
jected to the larger of the positive or negative load where
loads are combined as specified in Section 1605.

**2403.4 Interior glazed areas.** Where interior glazing is
installed adjacent to a walking surface, the differential deflec-
tion of two adjacent unsupported edges shall be not greater
than the thickness of the panels when a force of 50 pounds
per linear foot (plf) (730 N/m) is applied horizontally to one
panel at any point up to 42 inches (1067 mm) above the walk-
ing surface.

**2403.5 Louvered windows or jalousies.** Float, wired and
patterned glass in louvered windows and jalousies shall be
not thinner than nominal 3/16 inch (4.8 mm) and not longer
than 48 inches (1219 mm). Exposed glass edges shall be
smooth.

Wired glass with wire exposed on longitudinal edges shall
not be used in louvered windows or jalousies.

Where other glass types are used, the design shall be sub-
mitted to the building official for approval.

## SECTION 2404
## WIND, SNOW, SEISMIC AND
## DEAD LOADS ON GLASS
**2404.1 Vertical glass.** Glass sloped 15 degrees (0.26 rad) or
less from vertical in windows, curtain and window walls,
doors and other exterior applications shall be designed to
resist the wind loads due to basic design wind speed, V, in
Section 1609 for components and cladding. Glass in glazed
curtain walls, glazed storefronts and glazed partitions shall
meet the seismic requirements of ASCE 7, Section 13.5.9.
The load resistance of glass under uniform load shall be
determined in accordance with ASTM E1300.

# GLASS AND GLAZING

The design of vertical glazing shall be based on Equation 24-1.

0.6F<sub>gw</sub> ≤ F<sub>ga</sub> (Equation 24-1)

where:
F<sub>gw</sub> = Wind load on the glass due to basic design wind speed, V, computed in accordance with Section 1609.
F<sub>ga</sub> = Short duration load on the glass as determined in accordance with ASTM E1300.

## 2404.2 Sloped glass.
Glass sloped more than 15 degrees (0.26 rad) from vertical in skylights, sunrooms, sloped roofs and other exterior applications shall be designed to resist the most critical combinations of loads determined by Equations 24-2, 24-3 and 24-4.

F<sub>g</sub> = 0.6W<sub>o</sub> - D (Equation 24-2)

F<sub>g</sub> = 0.6W<sub>i</sub> + D + 0.5 S (Equation 24-3)

F<sub>g</sub> = 0.3 W<sub>i</sub> + D + S (Equation 24-4)

# CHAPTER 25

# GYPSUM BOARD, GYPSUM PANEL PRODUCTS AND PLASTER

User notes:
About this chapter: Chapter 25 contains the provisions and referenced standards that regulate the design, construction and quality of gypsum board, gypsum panel products and plaster and, in addition, addresses reinforced gypsum concrete. These materials are some of the most commonly used interior and exterior finish materials in the building industry. This chapter primarily addresses quality-control-related issues with regard to material specifications and installation requirements. Most products are manufactured in accordance with industry standards. The building official or inspector needs to verify that the appropriate product is used and properly installed for the intended use and location. Proper design and installation of these materials are necessary to provide weather resistance and required fire protection for both structural and nonstructural building components.

The provisions contained in this appendix are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance.

User note:
About this appendix: Appendix D establishes a framework by which a jurisdiction can establish a portion of a jurisdiction as a fire district. Fire districts are often designated in a more densely developed portion of a city where limiting the potential spread of fire is a key consideration. Within a fire district specific construction types and users are prohibited.

## SECTION D101
### GENERAL

**D101.1 Scope.** The fire district shall include such territory or portion as outlined in an ordinance or law entitled "An Ordinance (Resolution) Creating and Establishing a Fire District." Wherever, in such ordinance creating and establishing a fire district, reference is made to the fire district, it shall be construed to mean the fire district designated and referred to in this appendix.

**D101.1.1 Mapping.** The fire district complying with the provisions of Section D101.1 shall be shown on a map that shall be available to the public.

Where the average height of a building is two and one-half stories or more, a block should be considered if the ground area built upon is not less than 40 percent.

**D101.2.2 Buffer zone.** Where four contiguous blocks or more comprise a fire district, there shall be a buffer zone of 200 feet (60 960 mm) around the perimeter of such district. Streets, rights-of-way and other open spaces not subject to building construction can be included in the 200-foot (60 960 mm) buffer zone.

**D101.2.3 Developed blocks.** Where blocks adjacent to the fire district have developed to the extent that not less than 25 percent of the ground area is built upon and 40 percent or more of the built-on area is devoted to the occupancies specified in Section D101.2.1, they can be considered for inclusion in the fire district, and can form all or a portion of the 200-foot (60 960 mm) buffer zone required in Section D101.2.2.

## SECTION D102
### BUILDING RESTRICTIONS

**D102.1 Types of construction permitted.** Within the fire district every building hereafter erected shall be either Type I, II, III or IV, except as permitted in Section D104.

**D102.2 Other specific requirements.**

This image appears to be a page from Appendix D of a building code document, likely the International Building Code. It contains several sections with regulations regarding buildings in fire districts. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. Section D103.2 discusses other alterations within fire districts, stating that alterations are allowed as long as they don't create prohibited changes in occupancy or increase fire hazards.

2. Section D103.3 covers moving buildings, specifying that buildings moved into or within a fire district must be of a permitted construction type.

3. Section D104 addresses buildings partially located in fire districts, requiring them to conform to fire district construction types if a significant portion is within the district.

4. Section D105 lists exceptions to fire district restrictions, including:
   - Temporary construction buildings
   - Private garages (with size limitations)
   - Fences up to 8 feet high
   - Coal tipples and material bins of Type IV construction
   - Water tanks and cooling towers
   - Greenhouses under 15 feet high
   - Porches on dwellings (with size restrictions)
   - Certain sheds
   - Limited extensions to existing one- and two-family dwellings
   - Wood decks under 600 square feet
   - Wood veneers on exterior walls
   - Certain exterior plastic veneers

The document provides detailed regulations for construction, alterations, and exceptions within designated fire districts, aimed at maintaining fire safety standards in these areas.

# SECTION G105
# VARIANCES

## G105.1 General.
The board of appeals established pursuant to Section 113 shall hear and decide requests for variances. The board of appeals shall base its determination on technical justifications, and has the right to attach such conditions to variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes and objectives of this appendix and Section 1612.

## G105.2 Records.
The building official shall maintain a permanent record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance.

## G105.3 Historic structures.
A variance is authorized to be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of a historic structure upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure, and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.

**Exception:** Within flood hazard areas, historic structures that do not meet one or more of the following designations:

1. Listed or preliminarily determined to be eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places.
2. Determined by the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined to qualify as an historic district.
3. Designated as historic under a state or local historic preservation program that is approved by the Department of Interior.

## G105.4 Functionally dependent facilities.
A variance is authorized to be issued for the construction or substantial improvement of a functionally dependent facility provided that the criteria in Section 1612.1 are met and the variance is the minimum necessary to allow the construction or substantial improvement, and that all due consideration has been given to methods and materials that minimize flood damages during the design flood and do not create additional threats to public safety.

## G105.5 Restrictions.
The board of appeals shall not issue a variance for any proposed development in a floodway if any increase in flood levels would result during the base flood discharge.

## G105.6 Considerations.
In reviewing applications for variances, the board of appeals shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all other portions of this appendix and the following:

1. The danger that materials and debris may be swept onto other lands resulting in further injury or damage.
2. The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
3. The susceptibility of the proposed development, including contents, to flood damage and the effect of such damage on current and future owners.
4. The importance of the services provided by the proposed development to the community.
5. The availability of alternate locations for the proposed development that are not subject to flooding or erosion.
6. The compatibility of the proposed development with existing and anticipated development.
7. The relationship of the proposed development to the comprehensive plan and flood plain management program for that area.
8. The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles.
9. The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and debris and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site.
10. The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, streets and bridges.

## G105.7 Conditions for issuance.
Variances shall only be issued by the board of appeals where all of the following criteria are met:

1. A technical showing of good and sufficient cause that the unique characteristics of the size, configuration or topography of the site renders the elevation standards inappropriate.
2. A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship by rendering the lot undevelopable.
3. A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nor create

---

# APPENDIX G

nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public
or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

4. A determination that the variance is the minimum nec-
   essary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

5. Notification to the applicant in writing over the signa-
   ture of the building official that the issuance of a vari-
   ance to construct a structure below the base flood level
   will result in increased premium rates for flood insur-
   ance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insur-
   ance coverage, and that such construction below the
   base flood level increases risks to life and property.

This image shows a page from Appendix H of what appears to be the International Building Code, specifically focusing on regulations for signs. Here are the key points:

1. The appendix contains provisions for signs that are not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance.

2. It provides standards for the construction and protection of outdoor signs, using performance language where possible.

3. The document defines several types of signs, including:
   - Pole Sign
   - Portable Display Surface
   - Projecting Sign
   - Roof Sign
   - Wall Sign
   - Combination Sign
   - Display Sign
   - Electric Sign
   - Ground Sign

4. General regulations state that signs should not obstruct exit signs, traffic signs, or interfere with means of egress.

5. Some signs are exempt from permits, such as painted nonilluminated signs and temporary signs for property sales.

6. The document provides definitions for various sign-related terms.

7. There are location restrictions for signs, such as not obstructing fire escapes or ventilation openings.

8. The appendix is part of the 2018 International Building Code.

This appendix seems to provide a comprehensive framework for regulating different types of signs in buildings and public spaces, focusing on safety and proper installation.

This image shows a page from Appendix J of what appears to be the International Building Code, specifically focused on Grading regulations. Here are the key points:

1. The appendix is not mandatory unless specifically referenced in the adopting ordinance.

2. It provides standards for grading properties, including administration and enforcement of grading programs.

3. The appendix was originally developed in the 1960s for use in western United States jurisdictions.

4. Section J101 covers general provisions, including scope and flood hazard areas.

5. Section J102 provides definitions for terms like bench, compaction, cut, down drain, erosion, excavation, fill, and various types of grades.

6. Section J103 deals with permits required for grading, with some exemptions listed.

7. Key definitions include:
   - GRADING: An excavation or fill or combination thereof.
   - KEY: A compacted fill placed in a trench excavated in earth material beneath the toe of a slope.
   - SLOPE: An inclined surface, with inclination expressed as a ratio of horizontal to vertical distance.
   - TERRACE: A relatively level step constructed in the face of a graded slope for drainage and maintenance.

8. Grading permits are required except for certain exempted activities, such as isolated grading, excavation for permitted structures, cemetery graves, and exploratory excavations under professional direction.

9. The document emphasizes that exemption from permit requirements does not authorize any work to be done in violation of code provisions.

This appendix appears to be a comprehensive guide for regulating grading activities in construction and development projects.

1. Setbacks greater than those required by Figure J108.1.
2. Provisions for retaining walls or similar construction.
3. Erosion protection of the fill slopes.
4. Provision for the control of surface waters.

## SECTION J109
## DRAINAGE AND TERRACING

### J109.1 General.
Unless otherwise recommended by a registered design professional, drainage facilities and terracing shall be provided in accordance with the requirements of this section.

**Exception:** Drainage facilities and terracing need not be provided where the ground slope is not steeper than one unit vertical in three units horizontal (33-percent slope).

### J109.2 Terraces.
Terraces not less than 6 feet (1829 mm) in width shall be established at not more than 30-foot (9144 mm) vertical intervals on all cut or fill slopes to control surface drainage and debris. Suitable access shall be provided to allow for cleaning and maintenance.

Where more than two terraces are required, one terrace, located at approximately mid-height, shall be not less than 12 feet (3658 mm) in width.

Swales or ditches shall be provided on terraces. They shall have a minimum gradient of one unit vertical in 20 units horizontal (5-percent slope) and shall be paved with concrete not less than 3 inches (76 mm) in thickness, or with other materials suitable to the application. They shall have a depth not less than 12 inches (305 mm) and a width not less than 5 feet (1524 mm).

A single run of swale or ditch shall not collect runoff from a tributary area exceeding 13,500 square feet (1256 m²) (projected) without discharging into a down drain.

### J109.3 Interceptor drains.
Interceptor drains shall be installed along the top of cut slopes receiving drainage from a tributary width greater than 40 feet (12 192 mm), measured horizontally. They shall have a minimum depth of 1 foot (305 mm) and a minimum width of 3 feet (915 mm). The slope shall be approved by the building official, but shall be not less than one unit vertical in 50 units horizontal (2-percent slope). The drain shall be paved with concrete not less than 3 inches (76 mm) in thickness, or by other materials suitable to the application. Discharge from the drain shall be accomplished in a manner to prevent erosion and shall be approved by the building official.

### J109.4 Drainage across property lines.
Drainage across property lines shall not exceed that which existed prior to grading. Excess or concentrated drainage shall be contained on site or directed to an approved drainage facility. Erosion of the ground in the area of discharge shall be prevented by installation of nonerosive down drains or other devices.

## SECTION J110
## EROSION CONTROL

### J110.1 General.
The faces of cut and fill slopes shall be prepared and maintained to control erosion. This control shall be permitted to consist of effective planting.

**Exception:** Erosion control measures need not be provided on cut slopes not subject to erosion due to the erosion-resistant character of the materials.
